The Cloud Phone System is the Microsoft technology for enabling call control
and PBX capabilities in the Microsoft 365 cloud with Microsoft
Teams clients. (Please note that Skype for Business clients, while still supported by
Microsoft, are outside of the scope of this service.) The Cloud Phone System
allows you to replace your existing PBX system with a set of
features delivered from Microsoft 365 and tightly integrated into your
organization's cloud experience.

With the Phone System, your users can use Skype for Business Online and
Microsoft Teams to take care of basic call control tasks, such as
placing and receiving calls, transferring calls, and muting and
un-muting calls. Phone System users can click a name in their address
book, and Skype for Business or Microsoft Teams places a call to that
person. To place and receive calls, Phone System users can use their
mobile device, a headset with a laptop or PC, or one of many IP phones
that work with Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams. For admins, Phone
System provides the ability to manage calling within the same admin
console used for messaging, collaboration, and so on.

The project provides enterprise voice functionality to Teams in Office
365 / Microsoft 365 with the following features:

-   PSTN calling using Teams
-   Call hold/retrieve
-   Call transfer
-   Call forwarding
-   Camp On
-   Distinctive Ringing
-   Simultaneous Ringing
-   Voicemail
-   USB peripherals (such as a USB phone)
-   Delegation (boss/admin)
