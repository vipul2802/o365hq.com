We will develop a solution that will greatly
simplify the process of onboarding new employees in your organization
and delegate that process to authorized users without giving them Office
365 global administrator rights.

A sample scenario:

-   John, an employee in the HR department who wants to create a new
    user account, goes to a specific page on the SharePoint Online Site
    and fills out the form, providing all the necessary information.
-   John also indicates his supervisor who needs to approve the
    request to create a new user account.
-   John submits the form and his supervisor receives an email with
    information about the request and buttons to approve or reject it.
-   Once the request gets approved, John receives an email with the
    login and password for the new account, which he will provide to the
    new user.
