### Description

ShareFile to SharePoint Online migration typically involves moving files, folders, and other content from ShareFile to SharePoint Online while preserving important metadata, permissions, and security settings. This migration is often undertaken by organizations that are looking to consolidate their content management and collaboration tools, improve their workflow and productivity, or reduce costs by moving to a cloud-based platform.  

Migrating from ShareFile to SharePoint Online allows organizations to streamline their workflows using a single platform for file storage and collaboration. SharePoint Online offers advanced collaboration features such as co-authoring, versioning, and access controls that can help teams work more efficiently and effectively. Our **goal** is to help companies carefully plan, prepare and perform a successful and smooth ShareFile to SharePoint Online Migration without data loss or corruption. 

### IT Partner responsibilities 

1. Determine what data needs to be migrated and where it will be stored in SharePoint Online. Plan out the migration timeline, identify any potential issues or challenges, and determine who will be involved in the migration process. 
2. Make sure that ShareFile data is organized and that you have the necessary permissions to migrate files to SharePoint Online. You may also want to consider cleaning up any unnecessary or duplicate files. 
3. Develop a mapping plan to ensure that your ShareFile data is correctly mapped to SharePoint Online. This should include file names, metadata, and permissions. 
4. Test and perform the migration. 
5. Verify that all data has been successfully migrated and perform any necessary post-migration tasks.
