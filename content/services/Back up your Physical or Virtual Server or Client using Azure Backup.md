We will create a cloud-based backup service with unlimited scaling,
multiple storage options, unlimited data transfer, and data encryption.
Azure Backup's Recovery Services vaults may protect:

-   Azure Resource Manager-deployed VMs
-   Classic VMs
-   Standard storage VMs
-   Premium storage VMs
-   VMs running on Managed Disks
-   VMs encrypted using Azure Disk Encryption, with BEK and
    KEK
-   Application-consistent backups of Windows VMs using VSS and
    Linux VMs using custom pre-snapshot and post-snapshot scripts
-   Windows Server (or Windows computer) files and folders backed up to
    Azure using a Resource Manager deployment

Our objective is to provide backup and recovery for your physical
or virtual server or client using Azure Backup.

A Recovery Services vault is an entity that stores all the backups and
recovery points that have been created over time. The storage
replication option allows you to choose between geo-redundant storage
and locally redundant storage. We will select a backup goal, set
policies, and define items to protect.

Once a backup policy has been deployed on the virtual machine, that does
not mean the data has been backed up. We must also install the VM Agent
on the virtual machine, physical server, or client.

The last step is to check how the backup and recovery work and fix any
possible issues.

### IT Partner responsibilities

1.  Define backup points and policy with the Client
2.  Configure Azure Backup Cloud Service
3.  Install agents on the target systems
4.  Set up schedules and policies
5.  Verify the correct working of backup and recovery
6.  Perform test data recovery

### Client responsibilities:

1.  Coordinate Client resources and staff schedules
2.  Provide a dedicated point of contact responsible for working with IT
    Partner
3.  Coordinate any outside vendor resources and schedules
4.  Configure all network equipment, such as load balancers, routers,
    firewalls, and switches
5.  Review and approve engagement deliverables in a timely manner
