ATA identifies three main types of threats: cyberattacks,
abnormal activities and problems, and security risks.

**ATA technologies** can detect many types of suspicious
activity at various stages of an attack, including:\
- Collecting information about your infrastructure, during which
attackers can get data about the network structure and devices, such as
servers, network storage, or PCs\
- Implementation, during which attackers spread malware within the
network, using software vulnerabilities or unsafe settings of services
and servers\
- Managing a domain, during which the attacker collects
information that allows them to resume the attack using different
credentials, entry points, and vulnerabilities

Our **objective** is to plan, design, and implement Advanced Threat
Analytics service.
