We use the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) to migrate
your email from Gmail, Exchange, Outlook.com, and other email systems
that support IMAP protocol for email access. When we migrate
the user email by using IMAP migration, only the items in the
user inbox and other mail folders are migrated. Contacts, calendar
items, tasks, and other items cannot be accessed via IMAP
protocol and cannot be migrated through this process. If you have such
items in your email client, for example, in Outlook, you can migrate
them manually. We will provide advice and support for that process, if
needed.

Our *objective* is a full migration of all mailboxes from the source
IMAP system. Only users, emails, and email folders are migrated.
A migration project will be considered successful if all mailboxes are
moved to Microsoft 365 without downtime or data loss and with minimal user
disruption.
