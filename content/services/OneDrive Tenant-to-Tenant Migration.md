Usually, you will need this type of migration when a company merges or
acquires another company, or you would like to migrate to a different
geographic region.

The process of data transmission is implemented in two stages -- first,
we do the pre-stage migration and transfer all the files from one tenant
to another; depending on the amount of data, it can take quite a long
time. Employees can continue to work with their files
from any device without noticing the transfer process.

At the second stage, employees will need to temporarily stop working 
with files at a predetermined time. At this point, we will implement the
final transfer of data that has been changed since the first migration;
this is a much smaller amount of information, and its transfer takes a
short time, which results in a small period of
non-working time for employees.

We use our own software for the data migration. This allows you to avoid
data loss and errors during the transfer process.
