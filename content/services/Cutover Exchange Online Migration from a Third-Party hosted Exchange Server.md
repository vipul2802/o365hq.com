This service allows you to migrate from an Exchange Server to Exchange
Online if you do not have direct administrative access to the server.
Migration is possible using the credentials of each user.

This migration occurs in the cutover migration mode when all information
from mailboxes is immediately transferred to a new location.

During MX record switching, the email service may be unavailable. The
downtime depends on the DNS settings of your provider and the
DNS system features of email senders.

You can also use the additional email caching service, which will allow
you to receive all emails regardless of the MX switching duration.
