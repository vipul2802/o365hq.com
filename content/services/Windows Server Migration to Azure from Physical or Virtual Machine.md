Our **objective** is to provide migration of physical and/or virtual
machine(s) to the Azure Cloud. This project will be considered
**successful** when physical and virtual servers are deployed and
working stably in Azure.

### IT Partner responsibilities

-   Create a new recovery vault
-   Start to prepare the infrastructure; this is done by choosing your
    protection goals -- to replicate machines to Azure from the
    source
-   Prepare the Configuration Server
-   Enable replication for the VMs; this is where you select the source
    environment that was set up previously, the target environment (such
    as the storage account) to replicate the VM, the destination virtual
    network, and a VM that has mobility service installed

After migration, virtual machines will be running in Azure. Depending on
how you have your Azure environment set up, if you have a site-to-site
VPN or an Azure ExpressRoute, and if we migrated the virtual
machine to be in the virtual network associated with the VPN or
ExpressRoute, you can then change your on-premises DNS settings
to point to the new Azure private IP and connect to it. Provided that
virtual machines have replicated successfully, we can then decommission
on-premises or virtual servers.

### Client responsibilities

-   Provide a dedicated point of contact responsible for working with IT
    Partner and coordinate any outside vendor resources and schedules
-   Configure all networking equipment, such as load balancers, routers,
    firewalls, and switches
-   Provide access to physical and virtual servers and/or systems and
    services, as needed; provide remote and/or physical access to
    facility and systems required to complete the work
-   Perform changes to internal and external DNS, as required

### Outside the scope of this project (additional cost items)

-   Network configuration

Upon completion of the project, we will provide a *project closeout
report*. This document will indicate the final project status, including
evidence of meeting acceptance criteria, outstanding issues (if any), and the
final budget. If you require more extensive documentation, this can be
provided for an additional fee.

### Plan

The plan may vary depending on your needs.

1.  Kickoff meeting
2.  Define what we should migrate
3.  Start migration
4.  Final deployment
5.  Verify and fix issues, if any

### Results

You have modernized your infrastructure with the hybrid-cloud Azure-based
solution.
