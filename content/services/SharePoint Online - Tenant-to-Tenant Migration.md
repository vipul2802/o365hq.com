As more organizations move to Microsoft 365 during mergers and
acquisitions, they need robust solutions to consolidate their SharePoint
Online infrastructure and documents. We will help you migrate site
collections, sites, lists, and libraries with permissions and design.

Our **objective** is to migrate documents, sites, and structure from one
SharePoint tenant to another.

Project will be considered **successful** when all data has been moved
from one tenant to another correctly in an agreed time frame.

Our **responsibilities**. First, we check the source SharePoint Online
tenant for compatibility with the new tenant and help fix any errors (if
the destination tenant is not empty). In this type of merging, we use
special tools that provide a set of features and flexible options to
help us maintain data integrity, permission levels, version histories,
and metadata. We also use auditing and reporting tools to help plan,
configure, and granularly migrate content. We create the Document
Migration project and add the items that will be migrated to the
project. We then set the advanced project options and perform the
migration. Upon completion of the project, we prevent users from
inadvertently using older SharePoint libraries by decommissioning the
source SharePoint Online, libraries, and/or user accounts. After the process
is done, we verify files and structure and perform post-migration tasks.

### Client responsibilities

    services, as needed, and provide remote and/or physical access to
    facilities and systems required to complete the work
-   Perform changes to internal and external DNS, as required
-   Assist with identification of high-risk users (top executives and
    VIP users)
-   Designate a specialist who will provide useful information about
    content design and structure; someone who understands all the
    business processes inside your company

final budget. If you require more extensive documentation, this can be
done for an additional fee.
