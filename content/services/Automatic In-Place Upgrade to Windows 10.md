If your organization has PCs currently running Windows 7, Windows 8, or
Windows 8.1 and you want to perform an update to Windows 10 without user
interruption, we can provide this service and perform an automatic
remote upgrade during non-working hours, keeping all compatible applications
and all user files.

This service is provided for organizations having more than 25 PCs. If
you need to upgrade fewer than 25 PCs, please see [Manually in-place
