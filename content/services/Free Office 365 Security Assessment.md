description = "Small- and medium-sized businesses have to deal with the same cyberattacks and the same industry and government data regulations as large companies, but without the big IT department and budget to plan and implement protective measures. Migration to the cloud helps, but still leaves some very important vulnerabilities, like social engineering-based attacks. We will help you evaluate how secure your business data is and propose concrete steps to fix the vulnerabilities. "

Users face multiple threats, from credential theft (like Mimikatz,
password spray, or breach harvesting), to malware (viruses, ransomware,
and the like), to phishing (gaining access to a user's credentials) and
infrastructure attacks.

[Phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing) is by far the number
one threat for any company these days. Cloud-migrated organizations are
especially vulnerable because they have an almost perfect environment;
everything is configured correctly and documents, historic emails dating
back many years, and company info is available at **ANY time**,
from **ANY device**, from **ANY place**. Criminals
don't need to waste their time figuring out host names, encryption
types, protocols, and getting through some mistakes in integration and
external publishing of internal services. Everything works all the time,
everywhere. But there's a solution -- companies need to start using
tools and services that already exist and are built into the platform but
not enabled by default. Some of them are very powerful and free, like a
basic level of MFA. Some will require an additional license.

With the Free Microsoft 365 Security Assessment service, IT Partner will
connect to your Microsoft 365 tenant and use tools like Secure Score, Azure
AD, and PowerShell to generate a security report that will reflect your
current situation and contain a prioritized list of recommendations on
how to increase your data security, control, and protection.

Our **objective** is to assess your current security state and offer
solutions to remediate high-priority security concerns.

The project will be considered **successful** when you get information
about:

1.  Your single-digit Secure Score
2.  List of potential vulnerabilities sorted in order of importance
3.  Recommendation on how to increase your protection and Secure Score
4.  Quote for IT Partner's services in case you'd like us to work on
    your tenant hardening

### IT Partner responsibilities

-   Microsoft 365 data collection and analysis
-   Building of a security report

### Client responsibilities

-   Providing a dedicated point of contact responsible for working with
    IT Partner
-   Coordinating any outside vendor resources and schedules (if needed)
-   Setting up temporary access with global admin permissions

### Outside  the scope of this project (additional cost items)

-   Initial setup and configuration of any Microsoft 365 services
-   Gathering of any data located outside of Microsoft 365 tenant (for example, desktop
    computers, servers, and active networking equipment are outside the scope)

### Prerequisites

-   You must have a Microsoft 365 tenant used in a production environment
-   You must have a global admin access to your Microsoft 365 tenant

### Plan

The plan may vary depending on your needs.

1.  Kickoff meeting
2.  Identify security objectives
3.  Assess your current security state and identify security gaps
4.  Provide recommendations and best practices
5.  Create an actionable security roadmap
6.  Meeting to review the deliverables

### Results

You get a clear understanding of how to protect your cloud-migrated
business from sophisticated threats hidden in email attachments and
links; how to protect yourself from data leaks, helping you prevent sensitive
information like SSNs and customer credit card numbers from
being shared outside your business, as well as how to control and manage access to
information.
