### Description

Microsoft Yammer Tenant-to-Tenant Migration may be necessary when an organization is merging with another company, acquiring a new company, or restructuring its internal divisions and wants to maintain the same Yammer network for communication and collaboration. The process typically involves exporting the data from the source tenant Yammer network, configuring, and setting up the destination tenant Yammer network, and then importing the data into the new tenant. This includes but is not limited to users, groups, conversations, files, and other Yammer resources. This process can be complex and requires a detailed plan and careful execution to ensure minimal disruption to users and to avoid data loss.
