### Description

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the Internet.  It allows you to quickly scale up and down with demand and pay only for what you use. With IaaS you can avoid the expense and complexity of buying and managing your own physical servers and other data center infrastructure. The nature of the IaaS is that each resource is offered as a separate service component, and you only need to rent a particular one for as long as you need it. The cloud computing service provider manages the infrastructure, while you purchase, install, configure, and manage your own software—operating systems, middleware, and applications. 

As a result, you are getting the following benefits: 

* **Elimination of capital expense and reduction in ongoing cost**: IaaS sidesteps the upfront expense of setting up and managing an on-site data center, making it an economical option. 

* **Improved business continuity and disaster recovery**: Achieving high availability, business continuity, and disaster recovery is expensive since it requires a significant amount of technology and staff. But with the right service level agreement (SLA) in place, IaaS can reduce this cost and access applications and data as usual during a disaster or outage. 

* **Rapid Innovation**: As soon as you have decided to launch a new product or initiative, the necessary computing infrastructure can be ready in minutes or hours, rather than the days or weeks—and sometimes months—it could take to set up internally. 

* **Respond quicker to shifting business conditions**: IaaS enables you to quickly scale up resources to accommodate spikes in demand for your application— during the holidays, for example—then scale resources back down again when activity decreases to save money. 

* **Focus on core business**: IaaS frees up your team to focus on your organization’s core business rather than on IT infrastructure. 

* **Increase stability, reliability, and supportability**: With IaaS there is no need to maintain and upgrade software and hardware or troubleshoot equipment problems. With the appropriate agreement in place, the service provider assures that your infrastructure is reliable and meets SLAs. 

* **Best in class security**: With the appropriate service agreement, a cloud service provider can provide security for your applications and data that may be better than what you can attain in-house. 

* **Get apps to users faster**: You do not need to set up the infrastructure before you develop and deliver apps, you can get them to users faster with IaaS.
