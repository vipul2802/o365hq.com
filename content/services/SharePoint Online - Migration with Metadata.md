Managed Metadata is a hierarchical collection of centrally managed terms
that you can define and then use as attributes for items in Microsoft
SharePoint. It can be saved through migration. This service is
applicable to migration from Google Drive, Box, Dropbox, or OneDrive for
Business.\
Please note that if you only need file migration, see our other service.

Our **objective** is to organize a complete migration process for files
and folders from your source to SharePoint Online with metadata saving.
Project will be considered successful when all data has been migrated to
SharePoint Online correctly.

Our **responsibilities**. First, we check files and folders for
compatibility with SharePoint Online and help fix any errors. We then
identify what structure we should use in your future SharePoint
libraries and how to best classify your documents. For example, a
contract for a project you're doing for a client may be in a folder for
that client. After classification and structuring, we start migration
with metadata. When the process is done, we verify files and structure and
perform postmigration tasks.

### Client responsibilities

-   Provide a dedicated point of contact responsible for working with IT
    Partner and coordinate any outside vendor resources and schedules
-   Configure all networking equipment, such as load balancers, routers,
    firewalls, and switches
-   Provide access to physical and virtual servers and/or systems and
    services, as needed, and provide remote and/or physical access to
    facilities and systems required to complete the work
-   Perform changes to internal and external DNS, as required
-   Assist with identification of high-risk users (top executives and
    VIP users)
-   Designate a specialist who will provide useful information about
    content design and structure; someone who understands all the
    business processes inside your company

Upon completion of the project, we will provide a *project closeout
report*. This document will indicate the final project status, including
evidence of meeting acceptance criteria, outstanding issues, if any, and the
final budget. If you require more extensive documentation, this can be
done for an additional fee.

experience for every project. We can migrate documents and collaboration
files from any valid source to SharePoint Online.
