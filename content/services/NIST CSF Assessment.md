### Description

The NIST CSF (National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework) assessment is a process designed to evaluate an organization's cybersecurity posture and identify areas for improvement. The NIST CSF provides a framework of best practices, standards, and guidelines that organizations can use to manage and reduce cybersecurity risks.

The NIST CSF Assessment provides organizations with a structured approach to cybersecurity risk management and helps them align their cybersecurity efforts with industry best practices. It promotes a proactive and adaptive approach to cybersecurity and enables organizations to effectively manage their cybersecurity risks.
