### Description

Cutover email migration from any source system involves the definitive switch from the old system to the new system, typically performed over a short period of time, such as a few hours or days. The term "any source system" implies that the cutover email migration method can be applied regardless of the specific email platform or provider you are migrating from. Whether you are currently using Microsoft Exchange, Google Workspace (formerly G Suite), IBM Notes (formerly Lotus Notes), or any other email system, the cutover migration approach aims to move all email-related data and settings to the new target system. 

It's important to note that cutover email migration is best suited for smaller to medium-sized organizations with relatively simpler email environments. Larger organizations with more complex email systems or a significant volume of data may require alternative migration methods, such as staged or hybrid migrations, to ensure a smoother transition without disrupting business operations. Our **goal** is to help you successfully move all user mailboxes, email messages, folders, contacts, calendars, and other relevant data from the source system to the target system and ensure a smooth and efficient migration process.
