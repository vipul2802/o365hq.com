Often, companies pay more attention to external threats: spam and
phishing attacks, viruses (Trojan software, worms), website spoofing,
spyware and adware, and social engineering. But in fact, internal
threats can cause a company much more serious damage than intruders from
the outside.

In principle, any employee of the company can be a potential insider and
put information security at risk. No one is safe from malicious intent
or simple mistakes: from the lowest-level employee to top managers.

The operating principle of the DLP system is simple, and
consists of  analysis of all information: outgoing, incoming, and
circulating within the company. Using algorithms, the system identifies
the type of information, whether it is critical, and if it goes where it is not
supposed to go, the system blocks the transmission and/or notifies the
responsible employee about it.

The basis of DLP is a set of rules. They can be of any
complexity and relate to various aspects of the work. If someone
violates them, the responsible person(s) receive a notification.
