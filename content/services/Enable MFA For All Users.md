MFA technology adds a second factor during authorization. Using
MFA, users will have to use an additional authorization element, such 
as receiving a code via SMS, phone call, or confirmation with the help 
of a mobile application. This technology significantly reduces the possibility of
illegitimate use of the account; even if the attackers manage to learn
the username and password, they will not be able to bypass the
second confirmation factor.

We **strongly** recommend setting up this feature for all accounts.
