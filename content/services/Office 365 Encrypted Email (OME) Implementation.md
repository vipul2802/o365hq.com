Get secure email messaging implemented in your organization. With the
new Microsoft 365 Message Encryption (OME) capabilities, which
leverage the protection features in Azure Information Protection, your
organization can easily share protected email with anyone, on any device.
Users can send and receive protected messages with other Microsoft 365
organizations as well as non-Microsoft 365 customers using Outlook.com,
Gmail, and other email services.

Our **objective** is to enable OME -- Microsoft 365 Message
Encryption -- in your Microsoft 365 tenant and provide instruments to control
sensitive data with flexible policies or ad hoc customer controls that
are built into Microsoft 365.

An implementation project will be considered **successful** when you:

1.  start to send encrypted email from any device
2.  easily navigate through encrypted messages
3.  deliver encrypted email directly to recipients' inboxes
4.  decrypt and read encrypted email with confidence, without installing
    client software
5.  enjoy simplified user management that eliminates the need for
    certificate maintenance

### IT Partner responsibilities

-   Set up Office Message Encryption (OME) in Microsoft 365
-   Create mail flow rules that define the conditions for encryption
-   Bring your own key (BYOK) settings, if needed

### Client responsibilities

-   Provide a dedicated point of contact responsible for working with IT
    Partner and coordinate any outside vendor resources and schedules, if needed
-   Configure all networking equipment, such as load balancers, routers,
    firewalls, and switches
-   If Microsoft Outlook or other desktop email clients are to be used
    for connectivity to Microsoft 365, tuning email software on client
    workstations

### Outside the scope of this project (additional cost items)

-   Mail migration services to Microsoft 365
-   AD & group policy settings

Upon completion of the engagement, we will provide a Project Closeout
Report. This document will indicate final project status, including
evidence of meeting acceptance criteria, outstanding issues, if any, and final
budget. If you want more extensive documentation, this can be provided
for an additional fee.

### Prerequisites

-   You must have global admin level access to the source Microsoft 365
    tenant
-   You must have global admin level access to the destination Microsoft
    365 tenant, with Exchange Online licenses available

To use the new OME capabilities, you need one of the following
plans:

-   Microsoft 365 Message Encryption is offered as part of Office 365 E3
    and E5, Microsoft E3 and E5, Office 365 A1, A3, and A5, and Office
    365 G3 and G5. Customers do not need additional licenses to receive
    the new protection capabilities powered by Azure Information
    Protection.
-   You can also add Azure Information Protection Plan 1 to the
    following plans to receive the new Microsoft 365 Message Encryption
    capabilities: Exchange Online Plan 1, Exchange Online Plan 2, Microsoft
