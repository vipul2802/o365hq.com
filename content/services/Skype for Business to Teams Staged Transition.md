**Microsoft Teams** is a multi-functional, cross-platform messenger for
collaborative solutions of corporate tasks. Previously included only in
the paid **Microsoft 365** package, now Teams is also available for free
use. Messenger is designed for Windows, MacOS, iOS, and Android
platforms. It includes messaging, joint chats and conferences, file
sharing, and co-editing.

The messenger has integration with Microsoft 365 and supports collaboration
with Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, SharePoint, and Power BI
applications, as well as with third-party applications. Mobile versions
of Teams for iOS and Android allow you to always be in touch with your
team, sending and editing files remotely.

This migration occurs gradually in several stages, during which Teams
and Skype for Business clients can work at the same
time. This migration is suitable for large companies and with
