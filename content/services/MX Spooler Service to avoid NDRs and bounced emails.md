### Description 

Every day people send and receive billions of emails, which makes an email one of the most important business tools. Sometimes during acquisitions and mergers organizations must deal with tenant-to-tenant migration which involves the migration of mailboxes and service settings from one Microsoft 365 tenant to another one. 

Email is a fast, cheap and accessible method of business communication. Therefore, it is crucial for companies to avoid situations with NDRs (non-delivery reports) and bounced emails that can occur when moving an email domain between tenants.  We use MX Spooler Service to prevent your clients from receiving NDRs and help you ensure that all their emails successfully reach your mailboxes.
