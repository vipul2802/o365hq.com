This service will allow you to migrate Azure AD data from one tenant to
another. We can transfer:

1.  Virtual machines
2.  Databases
3.  Applications
4.  Websites

Transferring of each resource requires studying its involvement in the
workflow, downtime requirements, the load on the resource, and its size.
We will analyze all the resources used and, depending on your needs, we
will prepare a plan for the migration of data and resources,
minimizing negative effects of the transfer process on the work of
employees or other services.

The various resources hosted in Azure require individual changes and
have individual configuration features; this will be considered during
the creation of a migration plan.

External applications that use Azure resources but are not hosted
there will need to be reconfigured to use the new data.
