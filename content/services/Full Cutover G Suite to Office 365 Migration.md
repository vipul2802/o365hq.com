*Note that if you only need mailbox migration, you should
order IMAP migration from G Suite to Microsoft 365.*

This migration occurs with the help of a special utility that allows us to
move any amount of mail data, calendars, and other information in the
shortest time, avoiding possible errors during manual data transfer.

Our objective is to provide a plan and design a way to migrate to Microsoft
365, including email, contacts, calendars, tasks, files, and data. The
project will be considered successful when all user data is fully
migrated from Gmail and Google Drive to the Microsoft 365 tenant.

### IT Partner responsibilities

1.  Gather information and verify the original G Suite
2.  Configure the destination Microsoft 365 tenant
3.  Create and configure users
4.  License assignment
5.  Create and configure a migration plan
6.  Provide informational messages for users
7.  Start and control the data migration process
8.  Provide a OneDrive (SharePoint) profile for each user being migrated

### Client responsibilities

1.  Coordinate Client resources and staff schedules
2.  Provide a dedicated point of contact responsible for working with IT
    Partner and coordinate any outside vendor resources and schedules as needed
3.  Review and approve engagement deliverables in a timely manner
4.  Configure all network equipment, such as load balancers, routers,
    firewalls, and switches
5.  Perform changes to internal and external DNS, as required
6.  Assist with identification of high-risk users (top executives
    and VIP users, users with 50 GB mailboxes or larger and/or
    30 GB deleted folders or larger)
7.  Ensure IMAP Access is enabled for all users
8.  Ensure contact and calendar services are turned on for all users
9.  Users should not modify any documents in their Google Drive accounts
    during the migration, because any modifications will not be included
    in the migration
10. End user support

### Additional cost items not provided by the project

1.  Customer team training (could be added as an additional service)
2.  Corporate documents migration to SharePoint Online (could be added
    as an additional service)
3.  Desktop software settings

**Here are some limitations to be aware of**

1.  SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business have a limitation in
    file path length and file names. These limitations may cause issues
    during the migration from Google Drive. We may implement automatic
    solutions that can minimize such issues, but preparation is still an
    important part of the process
2.  The actual maximum  file path length within OneDrive for Business
    is 260 characters. However, library names and usernames are
    included in that limit, so the actual file path could be much
    smaller than 260 characters long. Also, certain characters need to
    be encoded and will reduce the available size even more
3.  File/folder name extension limitation
4.  There is a list of file extensions that are not allowed to be
    created inside of SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business

Upon completion of the project, we will provide a project closeout
report. This document will indicate the final project status,
including acceptance criteria matching, outstanding issues (if any), and the
final budget. If you require more extensive documentation, it can be
provided for an additional fee.  

This service offers a simple, secure, and cost-effective way to migrate

data.
