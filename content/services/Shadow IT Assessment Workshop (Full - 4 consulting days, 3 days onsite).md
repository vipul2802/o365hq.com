Our **objective** is to deliver the Shadow IT Assessment, including:

-   Good security principals that cover people, process, and technology
    solutions
-   Improve the security posture when it comes to usage of cloud
    applications and services
-   The assessment is based on the discovery of usage of cloud
    applications and services

### IT Partner responsibilities

-   Gain an understanding of customer's cloud security objectives and
    requirements towards cloud usage and verify them against real usage
    of cloud applications and services
-   Provide guidance, recommendations, and best practices on how to
    successfully use Microsoft Cloud App Security (CAS) to
    mitigate security threats that are associated with usage of cloud
    application and services
-   Provide a prioritized and actionable road map for the customer
    containing proposed actions based on user impact and implementation
    cost
-   Map Microsoft CAS capabilities and partner services to
    assessment findings, taking into account customer's security
    objectives and requirements

### Client responsibilities

-   Information: This includes accurate, timely (within three business
    days or as mutually agreed upon), and complete information
-   Access to people: This includes access to knowledgeable customer
    personnel, including business user representatives, and access to
    funding if additional budget is needed to deliver project scope
    Access to knowledgeable personnel who manage the firewalls, can
    provide credentials for log extraction, and can alter firewall rules
    if necessary
-   Access to systems: This includes access to all necessary customer
    work locations, networks, systems, and applications (remote and
    on-site)
-   A work environment: This consists of suitable work spaces, including
    desks, chairs, and Internet access.

### Prerequisites

-   Office 365 tenant and Microsoft Cloud App Security service, either
    customer production Office 365 tenant with CAS (through E5
    license) or trial Office 365 tenant and CAS trial (for up
    to 30 days)
-   Access to logs from customer firewalls or proxies
-   Infrastructure to host Log Collector (if applicable) [More
    info](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-app-security/discovery-docker)
    

### Plan

The Shadow IT Assessment typically consists of an up to two-hour
remote kickoff meeting, followed by on-site assessment workshops split
into three days (Day 1, 2, and 3) over up to four consecutive weeks,
preceded by preparations and followed by clean-up activities.

**Week One -- Kickoff**

-   Introduction to the engagement: objectives, flow, responsibilities,
    and governance
-   Provide and explain preassessment questionnaire to the customer
-   Make key decisions on resources and tools that will be used in the
    engagement

**Week Two -- Day 1**

Day 1 -- Education & Setup, whole-day on-site workshop

-   Review of questionnaire in order to get mutual understanding,
    especially over customer's cloud usage and associated security
    objectives and requirements
-   Provide education and readiness on Microsoft Cloud App Security
-   Technical setup of tools (tenant setup, log upload, Log Collector).

**Week Three or Four -- Day 2**

Day 2 -- Exploration & Discovery, whole-day on-site workshop

-   Review the CAS report(s) with the customer
-   Exploration of specific use cases of cloud usage in the portal
-   Creation of final report from engagement, highlighting discovered
    cases of Shadow IT (usage of unapproved cloud applications or
    services)
-   Creation of Cloud Usage Visibility and Control road map

**Week Three or Four -- Day 3**

Day 3 -- Review & Road map, half-day on-site (or remotely delivered)
workshop

-   Presentation and discussion of the final report from the engagement,
    highlighting discovered cases of Shadow IT (usage of unapproved
    cloud applications or services)
-   Review of Cloud Usage Visibility and Control road map

**Week Three or Four -- Day 3**

-   Removing uploaded logs
-   Decommissioning of Log Collector
-   Closing Office 365 and CAS trials (if needed)

[Please note.]{.mark} There's a specific need for extra time to be
inserted:

-   between Kickoff and Day 1 -- at least one (1) week -- time necessary for
    customer to prepare and fill in the questionnaire, as well as time
    for IT Partner to prepare some engagement tools (trial Office
    365 tenant and trial CAS)
-   between Day 1 and Day 2:
    -   at least 2 -- 3 days if using the manual method of uploading
        logs to CAS -- this time is needed for CAS to
        parse and analyze logs
    -   at least two (2) (ideally three) weeks if logs are uploaded to
        CAS automatically via the Log Collector -- this time is
        needed to collect, parse, and analyze a reasonable amount of
        logs
-   between Day 2 and Day 3 -- these days can potentially be adjacent,
    but for more sophisticated customers, it is advisable to
    insert a day or two to allow the partner delivery resource to work
    on preparation of engagement deliverables
