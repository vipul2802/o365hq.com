title = "Password-less Authentication"
description = "The common practice for IT to attempt lessening password risk by employing stronger password complexity, including special characters and demanding more frequent password changes, makes employees' work vastly more complex and decreases their productivity. Most importantly, this approach isn’t enough for current cybersecurity threats and doesn’t deliver on organizational information security needs."

Multi-factor password-less authentication is the solution that combines
usability and increased security. This service will allow you to develop
and implement a solution based on Microsoft Windows Hello and Microsoft
Intune.

### IT Partner responsibilities

1.  Discussion of the requirements for the user authentication process
    with the client
2.  Choosing the appropriate authentication solution
3.  Configuration of user profiles and devices in Microsoft Intune
4.  Configuration of authentication policy in Microsoft Intune
5.  Providing self-setup instructions of the workstation interaction
    with a specific authentication device for the users
6.  Break-fix for the solution within two (2) weeks

### Client responsibilities

1.  Informing users about changes
2.  Providing access to Azure management
3.  Providing remote access to workstations, if necessary
4.  The final configuration of each device (must be done by the
    employee-owner of the workstation)

### Additional cost items not provided by this project

1.  Initial setup of Microsoft Intune (if your organization does not use
    Microsoft Intune, you can order its configuration)
2.  Purchasing of licenses
3.  User training
4.  Azure AD configuration (if the company uses only On-Premises AD)

### Prerequisites

-   Microsoft Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) subscription
-   Azure Active Directory or Hybrid
-   All configured devices must be added to Microsoft Intune

### Plan

1.  Discussion of the requirements for the user authentication process
    with the client
2.  Choosing the appropriate authentication solution
3.  Configuration of user profiles and devices in Microsoft Intune
4.  Configuration of authentication policy in Microsoft Intune for a
    test group
5.  Testing on a limited number of devices
6.  Implementation of the solution for all employees
7.  Technical support

### Success Criteria

1.  Microsoft Intune is configured in such a way that it allows employees
    to use two-factor PC authentication and does not necessitate using a
    password
2.  Employees have successfully applied and are using the new
    authentication method
