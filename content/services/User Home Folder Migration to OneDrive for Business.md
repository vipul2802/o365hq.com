We will migrate files and documents stored in a user's drive or folders
on a file server(s) to the user's folders on OneDrive for Business. Please
note that this service is applicable to personal files and document
migration. See our other service if you want to migrate company-related
documents to SharePoint Online. Also, check if the personal files are
scattered on different storage systems, such as Google Drive, Box,
Dropbox, etc.\
Our objective is to migrate files and folders to OneDrive for Business.

### IT Partner responsibilities

1.  Verify current domain configuration
2.  Verify current workstation configuration
3.  Provide informational messages for users
4.  Prepare the domain for OneDrive for Business
5.  Configure redirection of work folders (Desktop, My Documents,
    Pictures, and others) in OneDrive

### Client responsibilities

1.  Coordinate Client resources and staff schedules
2.  Provide a dedicated point of contact responsible for working with IT
    Partner
3.  Coordinate any outside vendor resources and schedules
4.  Assist with identification of high-risk users (top executives and
    VIP users)
5.  Review OneDrive restrictions for file naming, file size, and file
    type, before deploying
6.  If your users use the Documents folder as an installation location
    for some legacy applications, the applications may stop working
    after folder redirection; if your organization uses legacy
    applications that do not support folder redirection, be sure to
    check them before redirecting folders to OneDrive
7.  If your users' Documents folders contain items with a very high
    frequency of updates -- such as databases, web servers, or Outlook
    OST files -- we do not recommend redirecting these folders to
    OneDrive
8.  Configure all network equipment, such as load balancers, routers,
    firewalls, and switches
9.  Review and approve engagement deliverables in a timely manner
