**What is Break/Fix?**

Break/fix is a method of providing IT support to customers. With this
model, the client asks for support from their service provider when a
problem arises, and the service provider solves these issues with a fee
for time or other resources spent.

But we are also ready to offer this kind of support for free if the
client purchases Microsoft subscriptions with our help, as a partner.

**Break/Fix vs. Managed Services**

Break/fix is different from managed services, a model in which a
company that provides IT services takes responsibility for customer IT
systems, providing monitoring, management, and continuity of services.

In the break/fix model, the IT company is involved in resolving
issues only if the client requests support.

MSP takes a proactive approach to prevent the manifestation of
the problem.
