### Meetings and collaboration

1.  Stay connected and in sync with coworkers and customers wherever
    you are via email, phone, online meetings, and IM.
2.  Get professional-looking email powered by Microsoft Exchange to
    facilitate collaboration to keep you in sync with your customers and
    coworkers, 24/7.
3.  Add audio/video conferencing to a new or existing meeting with just
    one click using Outlook with Microsoft Teams.
4.  Use Office 365 Groups to give your teammates access to a shared
    inbox, calendar, file repository, and/or notebook.

### Creating

1.  Create, share, and coauthor Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and
    PowerPoint presentations with coworkers.
2.  Get access to the latest version of your documents from your
    favorite devices, anywhere you have an internet connection. OneDrive
    for Business enables online and offline access and automatic syncing
    of files to reflect the most recent edits.
3.  SharePoint is an easy, drag-and-drop intranet for documents and
    files.

### Mobile productivity

    of your favorite devices (including Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android).
2.  Use OneDrive for Business to create, access, and edit your documents
    whenever you need them.

### No security risk

1.  Centralize control of your company data on personal devices.
2.  Reduce your risk profile with security features for SMB
    customers.
3.  Apply a consistent security configuration profile across managed
    devices.
4.  Establish a baseline of security policies across managed devices.
5.  Configure devices consistently to help ensure that your data and
    devices are protected from malware and external threats.
