**Azure Active Directory** is a cloud service that provides
Identity as a Service (**IDaaS**), authentication, authorization, and
identity management functions for the company's cloud and enterprise
systems.

Azure AD is based on flexible access control capabilities that help
ensure security and reduce operating costs.\
Azure AD can empower today's productive workforce.\
Azure AD upgrades access management and secure identity. The global
presence of Microsoft and extensive consumer experience are combined
with powerful user behavioral analysis and advanced machine learning
technologies to create the Microsoft Security Intelligent Graph, which
means Azure AD stops credential compromise before it begins. The goal of
this service is to help your organization continue the digital
transformation process and migrate identity management from on-premises AD
to cloud-based Azure AD, avoiding the problems that appear during the
migration process.\
It will allow you to increase the security and management of your users
and IT assets while lowering support and operating costs.
