We can provide the following services during the website/web app
migration:

-   Automatic scaling up and down to meet demand in busy times and
    reduce costs during quiet times
-   Automatic site backups to protect changes and data
-   High availability and resilience of the Azure PaaS platform
-   Deployment slots for development and staging environments, and
    testing of multiple site designs
-   Load balancing and DDOS protection
-   Traffic management to direct users to the closest geographic
    deployment

Our **objective** is to move your website from your web server to the
Azure App Service. Migration will be considered **successful** when your
web app/website works in Azure correctly and stably.

### IT Partner's responsibilities

IT Partner's responsibilities will depend on your choice of the above
items and may include:

-   Analyzing your web server installation, identifying which sites can
    be migrated to the App Service, and highlighting any elements that cannot be
    migrated or are unsupported on the platform
-   Installing and configuring Web Apps Migration Assistant
-   Migrating sites and databases from a remote server to Azure

The migration progress is clearly shown and we will see a summary screen
at the end, which details the sites migrated and indicates if they were
migrated successfully. It also provides links to the newly created Azure
web apps.
