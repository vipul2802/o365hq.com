Maintaining a backup and recovery solution is often less of a priority
than production issues, especially if your plant lacks technical skills
and/or time to implement an effective solution. But when a critical
data failure occurs, the value of a disaster recovery investment pays
dividends.

This service helps check backup and recovery status and assess the
strategy used to ensure your company can carry on its functions to a
substantial degree in the face of a major adverse event. It is not possible
to do this without a strong recovery workflow that lays out the process
of restoring information system functions to a degree that allows your
company to carry out its operations at an acceptable level within an
agreed upon timeframe.

Please note that if you need to create and deploy backup services, we
have another applicable service.

Our **objective** is to create the workflow for periodic tests of your
backup and recovery process.

This project will be considered *successful* when your backup and
recovery work without any issues.
