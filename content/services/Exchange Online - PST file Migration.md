We perform an Outlook .pst file migration to Microsoft Office 365
(Exchange Online). Importing .pst files to user mailboxes is one way to
migrate your organization's email, tasks, calendars, and contacts to
Office 365.

We have two possible ways to import .pst files to Office 365. The first
way is to upload the data files over the network to temporary storage in
the Microsoft cloud. The second way is to copy the .pst files to a hard
drive with BitLocker encryption and then physically ship the drive to
Microsoft.

Export and collection of .pst files can be performed either by IT
Partner or the Client, upon agreement.

### IT Partner responsibilities

1.  Hold a kickoff meeting to exchange contact information, plan key
    steps, and discuss the project
2.  Prepare .pst files for downloading in the selected manner
3.  Provide new Exchange Online mailboxes by creating Office 365 user
    accounts and assigning Exchange Online user licenses
4.  Add and validate email domain(s) to Office 365
5.  Start a migration batch
6.  Provide a report with the number of mailboxes that were successfully
    migrated and those that cannot be migrated, if any
7.  Set up incremental mailbox synchronization to receive any emails
    sent after the start of the main synchronization
8.  Resolve any migration issues and errors to ensure that all mailboxes
    have been successfully migrated
9.  Change DNS settings and control their application
10. Monitor health and status of the destination Exchange Online
    environment to make sure the migration process is correct

    firewalls, and switches
4.  Provide the authorization data necessary to complete the migration
5.  Ensure that contacts and calendars are exported to .pst files (if
    the export was performed by the Client)
6.  Perform changes to internal and external DNS, as required

    VIP users, users with 50 GB mailboxes or larger and/or 30
    GB deleted folders or larger)
