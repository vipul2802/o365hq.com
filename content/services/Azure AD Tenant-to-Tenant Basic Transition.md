Azure AD Tenant-to-Tenant migration will allow you to transfer Azure AD
data from one tenant to another. We can move users and groups, saving
all current logins. Please note that export of passwords from Azure AD
is impossible, so saving the current user passwords will not work. The
users will be assigned a temporary password they can enter in
the new tenant and create their own permanent password.

This service involves a cut-over migration, during which all data will
be exported from the source tenant and uploaded to a new one.
After that, all employees will need to reconfigure their devices if they
are using Azure AD authorization. It is also necessary to configure
applications and other services that use Azure AD. This option is
suitable for companies with a small number of employees and resources in
Azure.

You may also want to consider the staged data migration, which will allow
employees to use resources in one tenant and passing authorization in
another.

### Additional cost items not provided by the project

1.  Migration of other data from Azure, such as applications, mail,
    virtual machines, and databases (can be purchased as an additional
    service)
2.  Resource sharing setup between the source tenant and the destination
    tenant
3.  Workstation configuration. Please note that if employees use Azure
    AD authorization on their PCs, they will need to disconnect from the
    current tenant and connect to a new one; a new user profile will be
    created as a result. Services for PC setup and transferring data
    stored in a user profile can be purchased as an additional service.

Upon completion of the project, we will provide a project closeout
