### Description

Azure Files is a Microsoft cloud service that provides a cloud-based storage service that enables you to create and use network file shares in the cloud using SMB and API's with the option to use File Sync services for caching files shares locally. This solution helps you easily create multiple storage shares and sync with different locations such as branch offices. Azure Files has certain Key Features:

* Smart Caching with File Sync including cloud tiering, multi site sync, and fast file server DR.
* Large storage capabilities with 2 Petabyte storage account capacities.
* Its security features include encryption of data at rest and in transit.
* Includes integrated snapshot capabilities and cloud resiliency.  

Our **goal** is to configure all the necessary Azure components and connect the drive to one of your devices, along with detailed instructions on how to connect other devices.

### IT Partner responsibilities 

1. Configure Azure Storage account data hosting. 
2. Enable File Share access to a Storage Account. 
3. Set up File Share connection as a network drive on a single server or a workstation. 
4. Provision a configuration instruction for manual drive mapping to a workstation. 

### Client responsibilities 

1. Provide a dedicated point of contact responsible for working with IT Partner. 
2. Coordinate any involved third-party vendor resources and schedules. 
3. Facilitate configuration of all network equipment such as load balancers, routers, firewalls, and switches. 
4. Inform users about upcoming changes and provide the necessary information. 

### Additional cost items not provided by the project 

1. Informing users about upcoming changes. 
2. Customer team training (could be added as an additional service).
