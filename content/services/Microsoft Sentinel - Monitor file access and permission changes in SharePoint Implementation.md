### Description

Microsoft Sentinel is a cloud-native SIEM solution powered by AI and automation that helps you collect and analyze data in a security context from a variety of sources. With Microsoft Sentinel, you can detect various attacks and threats that occur in your services in real-time, quickly investigate them and if necessary, activate automation scripts.  

Often, having a restricted site with sensitive corporate information that only certain people can access, does not prevent your IT admins, IT managers, and other users with elevated privileges from accessing the corporate confidential data without your knowledge and this can become a significant issue for your organization. Microsoft Sentinel lets you quickly discover such unwanted changes and notify all interested parties with minimal cost and maximum preservation of your work principles. Though it will not be able to prevent unauthorized access, you can also consider other services - such as Azure Information Protection or Data Loss Prevention Policy. However, they are more complex to implement and require the participation of end users.  

Our **goal** is to connect your data sources (such as SharePoint for example) and set up all the necessary rules and notifications to keep you informed if anyone downloads/opens a certain file or makes changes in permissions. For example, if a system administrator adds himself as a site member to gain access to sensitive data, you will receive an email or a message in Teams. An incident will also be created in Microsoft Sentinel where you can find all the additional information and perform in-depth analysis if required.
