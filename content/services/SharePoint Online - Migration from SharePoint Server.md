With this service, your own SharePoint Server could be fully migrated to
the Microsoft Cloud. Please note, versions 2007 and earlier are not
supported.

Our **objective** is complete migration from your SharePoint Server to
SharePoint Online. The project will be considered **successful** when
all files, documents, and designs have been migrated and users start using
SharePoint Online as a replacement for your own SharePoint Server.

Our **responsibilities** are to prepare the source environment for
migration, including saving library templates. We then create a
SharePoint Online administrator or Site Collection administrator account
to be used for migration. Before beginning the migration project, we
create the structure of the document libraries, as well as the actual
document libraries on the destination SharePoint Online site. The next
step is to add the items that will be migrated to the third-party tool,
configure the advanced project options, and perform the migration. Upon
completion, we start post-migration tasks, like preventing users from
inadvertently using the source SharePoint libraries by decommissioning
the source SharePoint Server, libraries, and/or user accounts.

### Client responsibilities

1.  Provide a dedicated point of contact responsible for working with IT
    Partner and coordinate any outside vendor resources and schedules
2.  Configure all networking equipment, such as load balancers, routers,
    firewalls, and switches
3.  Provide access to physical and virtual servers and/or systems and
    services, as needed, as well as remote and/or physical access to
    facilities and systems required to complete work
4.  Assist with the identification of high-risk users (top executives
    and VIP users)

2.  Users' folder migration
3.  Mail server migration
4.  Consulting and development for SharePoint

Upon completion of the project, we will provide a *project closeout
report*. This document will indicate the final project status, including
evidence of meeting acceptance criteria, outstanding issues, if any, and the
final budget. If you require more extensive documentation, this can be
done for an additional fee.

Our tools, experience, and practices provide the best migration
experience for every project. We can migrate documents and collaboration
files from any valid source to SharePoint Online.
