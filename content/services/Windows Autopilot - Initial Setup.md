**Windows Autopilot** is a cloud-based deployment technology available
in Windows 10. It allows you to deploy and configure devices over the
internet with no interaction as an administrator or IT specialist. It is
built on existing modern management technologies like **Azure Active
Directory** and Mobile Device Management to manage and configure devices
by automatically enrolling in these solutions at their first
bootup, right out of the box.

Deployment of devices with **Windows Autopilot** enables a number of
capabilities for the deployment process and configuration of the devices
deployed. These features transform the way devices are deployed by
enabling customization of the first boot experience and providing
automated configuration of deployed devices. **Windows Autopilot** also
enables benefits from modern management solutions, such as:

-   presenting organization branding to users at the first prompt to log
    in via organization branding configured in AAD
-   automatic enrollment in Microsoft Intune or an alternate
    MDM solution with the configuration of automatic enrollment
    in AAD
-   Device configuration, policies, and apps defined by Intune or an
    alternate MDM solution begin applying to a device
    immediately upon the first logon, setting up the device for the user
    to begin working with and using the device

Our objective is that devices are configured and ready to work for your
users without requiring reconfiguration of the devices, access to
on-network resources, or even physical presence in your organization's
buildings or offices.
