This is a simple and well-tested technique for moving databases across
machines.

Also, if you have to transfer large amounts of data, we will help you
arrange to ship your hard drive(s) using the Azure Import/Export
Service (when uploading over the network is prohibitively expensive or
not feasible).

Please note that if you need to upgrade your SQL Server version,
we do offer that service here.

Our **objective** is to migrate SQL databases to an Azure VM on
the same SQL Server version.

This project will be considered successful when SQL databases
are available from Azure without data loss.
