This service provides document migration from Dropbox, Google Drive, and
Box to OneDrive for Business, Sharepoint Online, or Teams. (Please note,
the destination must be OneDrive for Business, not the personal OneDrive
version.) Source Google Drive accounts must be on a paid plan. Free
Google Drive accounts are not a supported source.

**Document migration could be from:**

-   Box to OneDrive for Business
-   Dropbox to OneDrive for Business
-   File server to OneDrive for Business (please check a separate,
    fixed-price
    [service](https://o365hq.com/services/onedrive-for-business-personal-document-migration-from-file-server)
    for that type of migration)
-   Google Drive to OneDrive for Business
-   Google Drive to SharePoint Online
-   Google Drive to Teams
-   Google Sites to SharePoint Online
-   Microsoft 365 Group to Microsoft 365 Group
-   OneDrive for Business to OneDrive for Business

Our **objective** is full document migration to OneDrive for Business,
Sharepoint Online, or Teams.

OneDrive for Business has certain limitations. It is advisable to be
aware of these limitations before migrating. We will identify and help
to fix errors, if any.\
During the project, we can notify users that a migration is occurring.
Throughout the process, they should not modify any documents in their
accounts because any modifications will not be included in the
migration.

After verifying data and completing migration tasks, we recommend
preventing users from inadvertently logging into a source system and
changing files.

    of users, and matching files to users
2.  Creating and configuring OneDrive accounts for users
