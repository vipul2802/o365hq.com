Single sign-on (SSO) means that users do not need to sign in to every application they use with separate credentials. A user logs into Azure AD once, and these credentials are used for other applications such as Sales Force, Slack, Zendesk and many others.
If you're an end-user, you probably aren't too interested in information about SSO. You just want to use productivity apps without entering a password every time. And we will help you to make it happen.

Single sign-on is a next step in the evolution of the user experience with third-party applications. SSO-based authentication systems are often referred to as "modern authentication". Modern authentication and single sign-on fall into a category of computing called Identity and Access Management (IAM).
