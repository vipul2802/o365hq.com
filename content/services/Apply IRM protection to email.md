Each file protected by IRM is placed in an encrypted container
along with a special label that defines the access rights to it. The
essence of IRM is that even if such a container falls outside
the network, it will be completely useless without access rights to the
document. This action is similar to the forced encryption of data placed
on removable media, which is often found in access control systems for
ports and peripherals. IRM technology allows the export of
confidential information in encrypted form only, which allows you to
always protect the company from accidental leaks, and quite often, from
planned information disclosure attacks.

Azure IRM allows you to automatically or manually protect
documents at various stages of their life cycle using tools integrated
into the operating system and the Microsoft Outlook mail client.

Azure IRM is responsible for authenticating users by requesting
rights from the IRM server, protecting and logging work with
documents and email messages under IRM policy.
