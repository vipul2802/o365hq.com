### Description

Information Rights Management (IRM) is a technology that allows the creator of a document or email to control who can access, modify, and share the content. IRM protection can be necessary when the content of the email is sensitive, confidential, or subject to regulatory compliance, and needs to be protected from unauthorized access or sharing. Here are some scenarios when applying IRM protection to an email may be necessary: 

* **Sharing confidential information**. If you are sharing sensitive or confidential information, such as financial data, legal documents, or personal data, you may want to apply IRM protection to the email to ensure that only authorized individuals can access it. 

* **Collaborating on sensitive projects**. If you are working on a project with a team and sharing project-related information via email, you may want to apply IRM protection to the email to prevent unauthorized access or sharing of the information. 

* **Communicating with external parties**. If you are communicating with external parties, such as vendors, customers, or partners, you may want to apply IRM protection to the email to protect any sensitive or confidential information that you may be sharing. 

* **Compliance with regulations**. If your organization is subject to regulatory compliance, such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI-DSS, you may need to apply IRM protection to emails containing sensitive or personal data to ensure that you are complying with the regulations.
