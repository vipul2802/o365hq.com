  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our **objective** is to enable email encryption in your Office 365
tenant and provide instruments to control sensitive data with flexible
policies or ad hoc customer controls that are built into Office 365.

An implementation project will be considered **successful** when you:

1.  send encrypted emails from any device
2.  easily navigate through encrypted messages
3.  deliver encrypted email directly to recipients' inboxes
4.  decrypt and read encrypted email with confidence, without installing
    client software
5.  enjoy simplified user management that eliminates the need for
    certificate maintenance

### IT Partner responsibilities

-   Set up Email Encryption in Office 365
-   Create mail flow rules that define the conditions for encryption
-   Bring your own key (BYOK) settings if needed

### Client responsibilities

-   Provide a dedicated point of contact responsible for working with IT
    Partner and coordinate any outside vendor resources and schedules, if needed
-   Configure all networking equipment, such as load balancers, routers,
    firewalls, and switches
-   Set up and configure the email client(s) on end-user devices
