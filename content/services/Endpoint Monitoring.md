### Description
With the help of this service, we can set up continuous monitoring of end devices, such as computers with Windows, Mac operating systems, but also printers, network equipment and various others. Monitoring works on the basis of an agent that is installed on the device and periodically polls the target device according to the specified characteristics. It could be performance metrics, such as CPU or disk throughput, available RAM, network interface utilization. As well, we can monitor Windows services status, HDD health, many others. Is it also possible to develop a custom script and check this script result execution.
We can also add any network active device, like network switches, firewalls, or even printers. It may be helpful to be noticed about strange and high activity inside network before it will affect users. As well, you may know about issues with printers and scanners.
The monitoring working based on pre-defined framework for checks, for example CPU is not higher than 50%, or printer status should be "ok", When checks failed we can generate a support request for this event and investigate the situation, and contact you if needed.
