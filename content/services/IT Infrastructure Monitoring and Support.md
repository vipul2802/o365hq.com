description = "IT systems monitoring is an integral part of  enterprise information infrastructure managing, which consists of constant control and periodic analysis of IT infrastructure components by tracking the dynamics of changes occurring with them. The key objective of IT monitoring systems is to obtain, store, and analyze information about the state of the controlled elements of the company IT structure. A special program allows you to quickly respond to problems in the work of IT services, as well as effectively prevent malfunctions. "

IT infrastructure monitoring systems are intended to control the
performance of network and server equipment and
business software. The monitoring program should control groups of
objects, information about which is necessary for administrators.

The implementation of a complex IT monitoring system helps the
enterprise to:

-   reduce downtime of IT structure components
-   increase the availability of software for business
-   perform proactive problem analysis
-   increase the productivity level of information resources usage

IT services monitoring systems are primarily focused on availability
level indicators, as well as the quality of service delivery based on
user ratings. During the process of system creation, a catalog of IT
services is formed. The indicators of availability and quality level of
each service and its dependence on other components of the company
information structure are determined. The system monitors IT components
and generates service performance indicators. IT systems monitoring is
useful for system administrators, IT department heads, and IT service
managers.

What is included in the complex monitoring system:

Network monitoring

-   IP network monitoring -- building and displaying network topology;
    collection, subsequent processing, and display of problem reports
-   network interfaces and devices performance monitoring -- collecting
    statistics on loading and the number of errors; reporting and
    forecasts

Server and workstation monitoring

-   Server performance monitoring -- obtaining data on various
    performance parameters, creating graphic reports
-   Hardware failures monitoring -- obtaining data on server hardware
    failures
-   Operating system failures monitoring -- obtaining data on the
    operation of the OS (using certain parameters)

Service and application monitoring

-   Programs and network services monitoring -- obtaining data on the
    level of their availability and performance using monitoring agents
-   Program failures monitoring -- collecting and displaying information
    about the operation of various applications (using certain
    parameters)
-   Application performance monitoring -- monitoring of the execution
    time of various operations and application resources
-   Service monitoring -- creating a service catalog, displaying data in
    the form of a hierarchically related structure

Data provision

-   Resource management system portal -- displaying data in a single web
    console
-   Reporting -- creating a variety of IT infrastructure functioning
    reports
