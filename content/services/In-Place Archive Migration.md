### Description

The In-Place Archive is Microsoft Exchange’s solution to long-term storage of email data. *In-Place Archiving* in Exchange Server helps you regain control of your organization's messaging data by eliminating the need for personal store (.pst) files and allowing your employees to store messages in an *archive mailbox*. Archive mailboxes are designed so that users can store historical messaging data outside their primary mailbox.  

Our **goal** is to help you move the archive mailboxes from your mailbox database to Microsoft 365 using the Exchange Management Shell and the Exchange admin center (EAC) in your on-premises organization. The project will be considered completed once all archive mailboxes have been safely moved and placed at the destination Microsoft 365 mailboxes.
