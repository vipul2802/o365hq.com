During the migration process, no matter how many elements are involved in
the migration, IT Partner's employees perform a number of actions
necessary for the successful implementation of the goals. This includes
both the tasks for technical specialists related to the configuration of
various systems and the tasks related to the project management and
interaction with the client.

Considering these actions, no matter how many mailboxes or users are
participating in the process, this service allows us to offer
the best prices for companies of any size.
