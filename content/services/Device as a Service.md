    flexibility in hardware and IT deployment.
2.  *Faster refresh rates:* Customers will receive the latest software
    upgrades with lower overhead cost, and can choose to have the latest

    and serves as an added employee benefit.
3.  *Ease of use:* Each Device as a Service offering will include all
    elements needed for a productive workplace, with one easy monthly
    billing and one integrated support channel.
4.  *Recruiting tool:* Because the new workforce demands the latest and
    greatest technology, customers can leverage new devices as a
    competitive edge as they recruit their new workforce.
