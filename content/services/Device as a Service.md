1.  *Financial flexibility:* Device as a Service lowers the barrier to
    entry for customers by shifting the financial investment from a
    capital expenditure to an operational expenditure. This is a great
    option for small and midsize businesses looking for scalability and
    flexibility in hardware and IT deployment.
2.  *Faster refresh rates:* Customers will receive the latest software
    upgrades with lower overhead cost, and can choose to have the latest
    device offering. This faster refresh cycle increases productivity
    and serves as an added employee benefit.
3.  *Ease of use:* Each Device as a Service offering will include all
    elements needed for a productive workplace, with one easy monthly
    billing and one integrated support channel.
4.  *Recruiting tool:* Because the new workforce demands the latest and
    greatest technology, customers can leverage new devices as a
    competitive edge as they recruit their new workforce.

Microsoft Cloud services, and your business aims.
