*Note that if you need partial mailbox migration (email and email
folders, without contacts, tasks, and calendar), you should
order IMAP migration from G Suite to Office 365.*

*You can also order Full Cutover G Suite to Office 365 Migration, which
includes GDrive data migration.*

This migration occurs with the help of a special utility that allows
moving any amounts of mail data, calendars, and other information in the
shortest time, avoiding possible errors during manual data transfer.

Our objective is to provide a plan and design a way to migrate to Office
365, including email, contacts, calendars, and tasks. The project will be
considered successful when user data is fully migrated from Gmail and
Google Drive to the Office 365 tenant.
