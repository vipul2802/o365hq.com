### Description

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is a security platform designed to detect and respond to threats in real-time, providing a comprehensive defense against malware, ransomware, phishing attacks, and other forms of cyberattacks. The platform includes a range of features to help protect your organization, such as: 

* **Advanced threat protection:** Microsoft Defender for Endpoint uses machine learning and behavioral analysis to detect and respond to threats in real-time. It also includes an extensive threat intelligence network to help identify and mitigate new and emerging threats. 

* **Endpoint detection and response (EDR):** Microsoft Defender for Endpoint includes EDR capabilities that allow you to investigate and respond to threats on individual devices. You can use the EDR feature to track the actions of a threat and take remediation actions to stop the threat. 

* **Vulnerability assessment:** Microsoft Defender for Endpoint includes a vulnerability assessment feature that helps you identify and address security vulnerabilities on your organization's devices. 

* **Compliance and regulatory standards:** Microsoft Defender for Endpoint helps your organization meet compliance and regulatory standards by providing security controls and reporting capabilities. 

* **Centralized management:** Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is managed through a central console in the Azure portal, allowing you to monitor and manage the security of your organization's devices from a single location. 

### IT Partner responsibilities 

The implementation of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint involves several responsibilities:
