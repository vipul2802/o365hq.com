Occasionally, a customer needs a migration inside the Office 365 cloud
platform. For example, if one company acquires another company and both
are using Office 365, there may be many reasons to start merging. 

Our objective is to provide planning, design, and migration of email
service from one Office 365 tenant to another. 

While the domain is transferring from the source tenant to the new tenant,
incoming mail will not be received for about 24 hours. This is due to
domain name binding features in Exchange Online.

To avoid the loss of emails during the transfer period, you can consider
the extended migration service.

### IT Partner responsibilities

1.  Export resources (mailbox-enabled users, contacts, groups, etc.)
    from the source tenant
2.  Import resources to the destination tenant via AD Connect
    or CSV import
3.  Do pre-stage migration (only emails and email folders older than 30
    days)
4.  Proxy services setup, which allows for receiving all incoming emails
    during a domain transfer
5.  Final mailbox migration with calendars, contacts, rules, and other
    data
6.  Change records in domain zones to accommodate migration needs

4.  If Microsoft Outlook or other desktop email clients are used to

5.  Perform changes to internal and external DNS, as required
6.  Assist with identification of high-risk users (top executives
    and VIP users, users with 50 GB mailboxes or larger and/or
    30 GB deleted folders or larger)
7.  Recreate new Outlook profile on all client workstations, if desktop
    Outlook version is used
