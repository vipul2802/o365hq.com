### Description

Public folders are a Microsoft Exchange feature that lets users share data like calendars, contacts, and documents. They provide a centralized location for users to access and share information within an organization. During the migration process, the public folder content is moved from the source server to the target server. The choice of migration method depends on various factors, such as the size of the public folder hierarchy, the amount of data to be migrated, the available network bandwidth, and the time frame for the migration. This can be done using different migration methods, including: 

* Exporting and importing public folders using PST files. 
* Replicating public folder data from the source server to the target server. 
* Using a third-party migration tool.

Once the migration is completed, users can access the public folder data on the new server. Proper planning, testing, and monitoring are critical to ensure a smooth and successful public folder migration. Our **goal** is to ensure that the migration is successful and that all data is migrated correctly to prevent data loss or corruption. 

### IT Partner responsibilities 

1. Define the best migration method based on the customer's requirements and the specifics of their Exchange environment. 
2. Assess the source environment to determine the scope of the migration and identify any potential issues that may affect the migration process. 
3. Start and control the Public Folders migration. 
4. Verify that all data has been successfully migrated and perform any necessary post-migration tasks.

### Client responsibilities

1. Provide a dedicated point of contact responsible for working with IT Partner. 
2. Coordinate any outside vendor resources and schedules. 
3. Provide temporary access to the existing environment/IT Infrastructure. 
4. Configure all network equipment, such as load balancers, routers, firewalls, and switches. 
5. Perform changes to internal and externalâ€¯DNS, as required. 
6. Inform users about upcoming changes and provide the necessary information. 

### Additional cost items not provided by the project  

1. Informing users about upcoming changes. 
2. Customer team training (could be added as an additional service). 
3. Desktop software settings. 

### Prerequisites 

1. It is recommended to use a dedicated network connection for the migration process to avoid network congestion. 
2. The user performing the migration should have appropriate permissions to access and migrate the public folder data, including permissions to read, write, and modify the public folders. 

### Plan 

1. Kickoff meeting.
2. Identify the public folder hierarchy, determine the migration method, and establish a migration timeline. 
3. Prepare the source environment and ensure the public folder data is organized and up-to-date. 
4. Prepare the target environment by installing the necessary software and configuring the network and permissions for accessing the public folder data. 
5. Test the migration process in a test environment to ensure that it works correctly and that there are no issues. 
6. Start the migration by copying the public folder data from the source server to the target server using the chosen migration method. 
7. Complete the migration and decommission the source environment once it is confirmed that the migration is successful. 
8. Provide post-migration support. 
9. Follow-up / closure conversations. 

### Success criteria   

1. All public folders are successfully migrated to the new environment and function as expected. 
2. All public folder data is successfully migrated without any loss or corruption of data. 
3. End-users can access public folders in the new environment using the same tools and interfaces they used in the old environment.
