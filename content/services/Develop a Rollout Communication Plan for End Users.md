Good change management relies on clear and helpful communication about
the upcoming changes. To smooth the path of your Microsoft 365 or Intune or
Dynamics 365 deployment, your rollout communication plan should include
four areas.

1.  What information is to be communicated
2.  The delivery method used for the communications
3.  Who receives the communications
4.  The timeline for communications

Let's review each item in detail.

### What needs to be communicated?

Determining what information needs to be communicated depends on when you are
communicating in the service rollout process. You might decide to
communicate in waves to your organizational groups and users, starting
with a service rollout kickoff, followed by pre-enrollment, and follow
up with post-enrollment. Let's discuss the type of information that
could be communicated in each wave.

### Kickoff wave

Broad communications that introduce the project itself. It should answer
questions like what is service being deployed, why the organization is
adopting it (benefits to the organization and users), and provide a
high-level plan of the deployment and rollout.

### Pre-enrollment wave

Pre-enrollment communications consist of broad communications that 
include additional information about the service and complementary 
offerings (for example, Office, Outlook,OneDrive, Intune), user 
resources, and specific timelines for when organization groups 
and users are scheduled to receive the service.

### Enrollment wave

During enrollment, communications targeting organization groups and users that are
scheduled to receive the service will be needed. These should inform the users that
they are ready to receive enrollment and provide enrollment instructions along
with contact information for getting assistance or asking questions.

### Post enrollment wave

After enrollment, communications targeting organization groups and users that have
enrolled in the service will be necessary. These should provide additional resources that
might be helpful to the user, and collect feedback about their
experience during and after enrollment.

You may find this end user enrollment guide helpful. You can use it as
is or modify it for your organization.

### Communication delivery methods

There are several delivery methods you can use to communicate the
service rollout information to your targeted organizational groups and
users. The following list shows some examples and the wave you can use
the method with:

-   Organizational-wide in-person or Microsoft Teams meetings used for
    kickoff wave
-   Email used for pre-enrollment, enrollment, and post-enrollment waves
-   Organization websites used for all waves
-   Yammer, posters, and flyers used for kickoff and pre-enrollment
    waves

### Communications timeline

After determining what you need to communicate and the methods you will
use, determine the timeline for your communications that includes when
and who would receive the communications.

For example, the initial project kickoff communications can target the
entire organization or just a subset, and take place over several weeks
before the service rollout begins. After that, the information could be
communicated in waves to organizational groups and users, aligned with
their service rollout schedule. The following example is a sample
high-level Intune rollout communications plan.
