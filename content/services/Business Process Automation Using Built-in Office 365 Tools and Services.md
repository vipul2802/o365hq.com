**Business Process Automation** provides the following benefits:

1.  Elimination of routine and repetitive manual operations
2.  Information is processed and transmitted much faster
3.  The entire enterprise or separate units receive service in a single
    information space
4.  Programmed reports and documents are generated automatically
5.  The convenience of database operation increases and the work becomes
    more accurate, complete, and non-contradictory
6.  Human errors are eliminated
7.  Work efficiency of employees is increased
8.  The whole organization (or separate units) becomes a single complex
    that is combined by regular standardized business processes and
    information systems

Our **objective** is to plan, design, and develop a necessary solution.

### IT Partner responsibilities

Create and implement one of the following automation services:

1.  Approval process when a new item is added to SharePoint. The
    approver can view their approval requests in the Approvals Center and
    by email. Once an item is approved or rejected, the item creator
    receives a confirmation email
2.  Tracking your work hours and work location. Each button tap logs the
    current time and location to an Excel table
3.  Keeping up to date on new customer opportunities. Instead of
    manually tracking sales leads, let Microsoft Flow notify you of new
    Dynamics 365 or Salesforce opportunities as they're generated
4.  Getting notified about negative posts on social media like Twitter
    and Facebook
