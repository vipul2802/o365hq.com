### Description

Providing remote workstations (VDI) and terminal server services across a company, even a small one, requires a significant amount of work for administrators. Most of the time is spent configuring and integrating lots of components that this service consists of. Microsoft suggests looking at this challenge in a new way with Windows Virtual Desktop (WVD). WVD is a cloud-based desktop virtualization service and applications based on Microsoft Azure. The main benefits of WVD include:

•	Integration and management of components responsible for providing remote desktops and applications. Microsoft offers them free of charge as a service with an SLA.  
•	Licenses for using and accessing the OS. They are already included in many popular Microsoft packages and do not require any additional costs, minimizing the overall price of the solution.
•	The service provides the ability to use Windows 10 in the terminal server format, minimizing the cost of the session.

1.	Check prerequisites 
2.	Create an Azure subscription, if needed
3.	Configure Azure services required for Windows Virtual Desktop 
4.	Create virtual machines in the Host Pool (up to 5 VMs)
5.	Provide instructions on connecting to Windows Virtual Desktop
6.	Consultation on technical issues related to the work of WVD 
 

### Client responsibilities
