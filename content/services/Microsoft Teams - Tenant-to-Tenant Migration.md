This is a service description for the Microsoft Teams migration service
from one Office 365 tenant to another. Usually, you will need this type
of migration when a company merges or acquires another company, or you
would like to migrate to a different geographic region.

Our **objective** is to plan, design, and migrate Microsoft Teams service
from one Office 365 tenant to a different Office 365 tenant.

A migration project will be considered **successful** when Microsoft
Teams data is migrated without loss of data within an agreed time frame
and without downtime for users. What would be migrated:

1.  Teams and channels
2.  Files stored in Teams
3.  Channels inside Teams
4.  User membership information

### IT Partner responsibilities

1.  Identify data such as the team, channel, and the files contained in them
    in the source tenant
2.  Creation of appropriate team and channel structure in the
    destination tenant
3.  Transfer files stored in the team and channel to a new tenant
4.  Providing owner access to all Teams in destination tenant

### Client responsibilities

1.  Provide a dedicated point of contact responsible for working with IT
    Partner
2.  Coordinate any outside vendor resources and schedules, if needed
3.  If Microsoft Team desktop clients are to be used for connectivity to
    Office 365, reconfigure those clients
4.  Manage user membership in Teams

### Outside the scope of this project (additional cost items)

1.  Inform users about upcoming changes
2.  Desktop software settings

### Prerequisites

1.  You must have global admin level access to the source Office 365
    tenant
2.  You must have global admin level access to the destination Office
    365 tenant with Teams license available

### Plan

The plan may vary depending on your needs.

1.  Kickoff meeting
2.  Determine source data
3.  Pre-stage migration
4.  Migration validation and access provision
5.  Final data migration

### Success criteria

Users can access the Microsoft Teams service in the destination tenant
from their desktop PCs, mobile phones, and tablets from any place, any
time. All the data (Teams, channels, and files) are migrated from the source
tenant to the destination tenant without loss or downtime.
