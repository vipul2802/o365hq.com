While vendors seek to improve email protection mechanisms, attackers
are developing protection bypass methods, inventing new ways of targeted
phishing, sometimes using the negligence of employees or the lack of
effective solutions against spam and phishing.

This service will help you start using modern protection solutions, such
as Exchange Online Advanced Threat Protection, which helps protect
employees from viruses and malware. DKIM and DMARC
function setup significantly reduces the ability to send phishing from
your company's domain, including to your address (the practice of
sending out specially prepared letters on behalf of employees of one
company, actually sent by attackers, has recently become very common).
We will also check your domain settings and make changes, if necessary.
Blocking the receipt of mail based on regional data can also be enhanced by 
eliminating the possibility of attacks from countries
with increased viral activity.
