MS CAS is a cloud-based service that aims to protect the work of
cloud services, but it also allows you to monitor employees' personal
devices, obtains information about the security of these devices,
vulnerabilities, attempts to hack devices, the possibility of
credentials being compromised, and suspicious activity. This service has
convenient data visualization capabilities, can analyze data to identify
threats, has flexible management policies, and automates security monitoring
processes. All these features minimize the security specialist's
workload while maintaining a high level of control and protection. MS
CAS transparently integrates into the work of employees and
does not create problems in their daily routine.

**With this service, we are focused on using MS CAS in the
Microsoft Cloud services protection scenario**

1.  Data protection and privacy, including the use of the Conditional
    Access App Control
2.  Prevention of information theft
3.  Forced data encryption and control of the device network location
4.  Detection of suspicious and viral activity, possible attacks
5.  Bringing cloud infrastructure to match industry-standard
    requirements, including analysis of used applications and potential

Your company may have personalized requirements for customizing this
solution and we will take these into consideration while implementing Microsoft Cloud
App Security, allowing you to attain a reliable and secure, yet easy to
manage, work environment.
