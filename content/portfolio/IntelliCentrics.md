It is vital to Intellicentrics that our corporate files remain secured both internally and externally. This is precisely the achievement with IT Partners, safe and secure intelligence. "

The planning and staging process for the Exchange migration was surprisingly quick and finished ahead of schedule. At the request of Intellicentrics, the cut over to the new exchange server occurred on the morning of a business day; and while this impacted every employee, the experience was smooth, and there was virtually no downtime for staff. A few minor issues arose the day of migration, and IT Partner was quick to resolve each One. Many team members (technical and non-technical) commented how impressed they were with the smooth transition. The disruption was remarkably less significant than feared and is common with this type of a project.

The migration of the file server to SharePoint online was equally successful. The shift from a natively mounted filesystem to SharePoint Online presented a bit of a learning curve for our team. The additional features for auditing, versioning, and secure access provide our team with higher productivity and efficiency. Ultimately giving the IntelliCentrics team the ability to provide our customers with a higher service level.

Over the course, all interactions with IT Partner were friendly, professional and very informative. No matter how small or complex the question was, IT Partner took the time to ensure we had a clear answer or recommendation. In cases where IT Partner disagreed with the direction requested, they provided a detailed explanation of why and how to better achieve the goals. Both projects were executed with efficiency while minimizing potential risks.

We appreciate all of IT Partner&#8217;s efforts and guidance and will be looking to them for any future Microsoft consulting services we may need. And it goes without say; we would recommend IT partners.
