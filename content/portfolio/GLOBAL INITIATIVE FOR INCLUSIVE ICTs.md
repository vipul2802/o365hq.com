G3ict called on IT Partner’s support services in 2016 to migrate its web sites from a legacy platform to AZURE as well as its entire office and email exchange to Microsoft under an E3 Office 365 license.

This migration occurred in very difficult circumstances as the hosting company we used abruptly announced that it would be selling its hosting business to another company and that some legacy customers, including our organization, could not be migrated for technical reasons.  With a deadline of a few days, we were at risk of losing precious data accumulated during the past 10 years and which is widely used by the public around the world.  As a lean low overhead non-profit organization, we did not have anyone on staff with the technical expertise to handle this situation.

From the first day of our agreement being in place, Michael Makeyev, Oleg Shalnov and their colleagues demonstrated an incredible level of commitment to make things work.  This included many extra hours spent late at night and over weekends to back up data and meet our migration deadlines which we could not afford to miss.  With an old, complex and diverse set of web sites, custom web page re-programming were necessary, which Michael and his team handled successfully.  I should add that being the beneficiary of special Microsoft rates as a non-profit, Michael and his team were also very effective helping us coordinate our migration with Microsoft. 

To our greatest relief, the migration was completed for both our web sites and email system on time and without a glitch.  Because of this positive experience, we entered into an ongoing support services contract with IT Partner.  With more than a year of experience, I can only say that the support we receive is always prompt, professionally handled, knowledgeable and effective.  We could not be happier.  Beyond support that works, IT Partner has also helped us fully leverage the many tools available under our licenses with Microsoft.
