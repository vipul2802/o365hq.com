Dear Michael,

To summarize, we have been pleased with the services that were provided to OSR by IT Partner &#8211; both with respect to the project work outlined in our SOW, and in serving as a conduit for support and additional services added to our O365 solution post-project. While there were some (not unexpected) hiccups specific to the project, the project management and technical team for IT Partner worked through them methodically, and IT Partner staff were timely in communicating status and results to the OSR team. All in all, a job well done.

A hearty thanks to the IT Partner team. As additional needs arise, we look forward to the opportunity to work with you again.
