In the fall of 2017, Columbus Municipal School District needed to synchronize Active Directory with Office 365, providing email accounts in Office 365 for students while maintaining staff email accounts in the existing Exchange on premise environment. IT Partner was engaged to complete this project. As with most companies, email is an integral part of our business and there was much concern about downtime during the process. Using IT Partner to complete this project removed the stress for me. With their expertise they were able to complete the project without an impact on our users.

I found the IT Partner team to be very knowledgeable, prompt, accessible and easy to work with. I was very satisfied with the services they provided. Based on my experience, I would definitely consider utilizing them for other Microsoft-related projects and I can confidently recommend them to other companies.
