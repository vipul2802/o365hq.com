We want to express our satisfaction for IT Partner and the competent, skilled job they performed with our migration. Through this project, SeaTrek Enterprises has built a lasting relationship with IT Partner. At no point in this project did we feel neglected or ignored. The team at IT Partner did a fantastic job communicating with our team at Sea-Trek Enterprises. It is evident that IT Partner values customer service above all else.

Michael and his team were only a phone call away for any question we ever needed answered or any concern we needed resolved. Almost 1 year later, they continue with support in less than 5 minutes each time we need them.

Sea-Trek Enterprises is pleased with Microsoft Office 365 and couldnâ€™t be happier with our decision to implement this product in our company. Seat-Trek Enterprises is even more pleased with how smooth the implementation process was. It was quick and easy. 

Our experience with IT Partner was excellent. IT Partner is very professional and extremely qualified in the field of information technology. Sea-Trek Enterprises, with zero reservations, recommends IT Partner to any company looking to make the switch to Microsoft and more specifically, Office 365.
