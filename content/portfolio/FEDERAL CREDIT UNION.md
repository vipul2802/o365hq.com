Ever since we signed our contract, IT Partner has demonstrated the highest quality customer service. It was far and above the least stressful project we have ever undertaken. IT Partner Team was quick to resolve any issues that arose during the migration process. Their attention to details was superior and they managed to complete the project on-time and on-budget."

We were lucky to have someone with such experience to guide us through the complicated migration process. As a result, all our mailboxes were successfully moved from an existing email system to Exchange Online. We were so glad that our email service didn&#8217;t get disrupted during the migration!

IT Partner staff really came through, proving what it means to be a “team player.” IT Partner cloud engineers are professional, conscientious and helped our users easily access their email, calendars, and contacts in Outlook Web Access (OWA), Mobile Devices, Tablets, and full version of Outlook. They continue to provide support for this project and help things run smoothly. We would recommend their services to other companies as IT Partner completely meets our requirements and our team couldn&#8217;t be more satisfied with their work.
