In Summer/Fall of 2017 our company, Raxco Software, Inc., decided to undergo some major changes in our email technology infrastructure – migrating from Exchange on-premises to Office 365/Exchange.  Microsoft referred Raxco to IT Partner, LLC to help us accomplish this project.  I am extremely pleased with the service rendered by IT Partner and have absolutely no complaints or issues.  From start to finish, this project was performed quickly, and it was extremely well executed.

Throughout the entire process, Michael and Oleg were easy and enjoyable to work with. Oleg helped us implement these changes on the technology end, while Michael assisted by working through our concerns and answering any questions we had. Michael was always responsive and available any time of day we needed him. After the project was completed, IT Partner went the extra mile by helping us reinstall Azure AD Connect after a server failure. 

I would highly recommend IT Partner to any company who is looking to implement Microsoft products or switch to cloud-based services. They were very personable and able to tailor their products to our specific company needs. We were so pleased with the service of IT Partner that we are currently considering their services in transitioning to Microsoft Azure. You can’t go wrong with IT Partner, LLC.
