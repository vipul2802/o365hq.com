I selected IT Partner, LLC after reviewing it on Microsoft’s partner center . I couldn’t be more pleased with the decision. Utilizing their services saved me time, stress, and money. In every way, IT Partner, LLC has lived up to their gold star partner rating by going above and beyond our expectations. IT Partner, LLC was very timely with our project and the entire process to implement our project was shorter than expected. 

Thanks to Michael and Oleg’s competence and skills, there were zero roadblocks that came up along the way. This was one of those rare projects that was smooth from start to finish. I also appreciated Michael’s responsiveness and mindset. Michael’s determination and desire to follow through was a huge key to our success.

Specifically, IT Partner was able to transition my office to Microsoft Azure, configure Azure Network Security Group, set up our VM server, and fix our Remote Desktop Easy Print. We are grateful to have saved time and stress in this endeavor by relying on IT Partner, LLC to help us. 

I have already referred several colleagues to IT Partner, LLC because of their superior service and skills. I would also recommend IT Partner’s services to any other company looking to upgrade or transition to Microsoft based products and services. You will not regret it.

Sincerely, Cheryl K. Woods, CPA
