Microsoft 365 Business Premium is a set of collaboration products and IT
tools, such as Conditional Access, Microsoft Intune, Azure AD, ATP, and
more. It offers a smooth performance experience for your remote
employees by approaching security in terms of Securing Access, Securing
Devices and Securing Data.

Securing Access empowers work from home scenarios in a secure manner --
from anywhere and any device:

1.  Conditional Access helps you control access to your environment
    based on location, app, device state and user state.
2.  Multi-Factor Authentication protects your business environment
    against lost or stolen passwords. [Learn more about setting up
    MFA](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/set-up-multi-factor-authentication?view=o365-worldwide)
3.  App Proxy lets your employees access remotely on premises apps
    without opening broad access to their network. [Learn more about
    enabling Azure AD App
    Proxy.](https:/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-application-proxy)
4.  Windows Virtual Desktop (WVD) allows you to build a virtual desktop
    for workers to access remotely. They will only be able to access the
    info in the remote virtualized session and are unable to save any
    data on their local workstations.

Securing Devices is getting difficult while people use laptops, desktops
and mobile devices to access company data and get work done during this
time. Microsoft Intune is a great way to keep their PCs and mobile
devices safe:

1.  Mobile Device and App Management makes it easy to manage your work
    data on mobile apps and gain more flexibility on how much control
    you want to exert on mobile devices accessing your company
    environment.
2.  Intune helps you keep devices up to date, strengthen security
    policies or clean data remotely. In Microsoft 365 Business Premium,
    it is easy to set up Microsoft Defender AV and ransomware protection
    for critical folders.
3.  Autopilot allows you to Automate Windows deployment to bypass
    traditional image-based deployment and automate provisioning of
    apps, configurations and user settings.

Securing Data is another crucial step to make sure that company data is
protected. It is also important to prevent phishing and ensure that
confidential data like SSNs and personal identifiable information (PII)
are secured and the policies are in place to control access as well as
sharing:

1.  Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is used to protect against accidental
    data leaks. This feature allows you to detect, monitor and defend
    confidential data from being unintentionally shared either through
    email or in documents. It also helps users learn how to stay
    compliant without interrupting their workflow.
2.  Azure Information Protection (AIP) controls access to data and
    documents. It allows you to decide whether an email or a document
    can be viewed, forwarded or printed by a non-employee.
3.  Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection provides security solutions
    against complex phishing and ransomware attacks within email,
    OneDrive and Teams. It keeps your business secure with the help of
    sophisticated attachment scanning in email, automatic checks of
    links in email, documents, Teams and Anti-spoofing intelligence.

4.  Cloud App Discovery prioritizes apps and identifies high-risk users.
    It allows you to integrate applications to enable single sign-on and
    user management.
