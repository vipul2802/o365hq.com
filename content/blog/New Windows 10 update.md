What is new?

**Timeline**\
The service operates on the basis of the "History of tabs" in browsers
and stores information about previously opened sites and files. It also
displays data about tabs from the Edge browser and files from Microsoft
365, on both Android and iOS devices.

**Focus Assist**\
This function will help keep concentration, disabling notifications
from social networks, email clients, and other services at the right
time. Upon completion of the work, the user will receive all emails and
notifications. To receive important calls or messages, the user is
encouraged to use the list of exceptions.

**Microsoft Edge**\
In the browser, you can turn off sound on separate tabs and save data to
fill out payment forms. People who have difficulty reading will benefit
from the Grammar Tools button. It will break the words on the page into
syllables.

**Voice control**\
The Dictation function will make it possible to create notes or a
document using only the voice. Control devices for the "smart home" are 
through the assistant Cortana.

**Delivery Optimization**\
The service allows you to download the update to one device and then
transfer it to the rest using a local network. This will reduce the
amount of traffic consumed by 90%. Delivery Optimization statistics will
be available in Windows Analytics. In particular, it will show how many
devices are updated and how much bandwidth is saved.

**Compatibility**\
The Readiness Toolkit for Office helps to check the compatibility of
VBA macros and various Office add-ins. Application Health
Analyzer identifies dependencies in user-developed applications and
ensures that they are compatible with Windows 10 updates.

**ConfigMgr**\
In the recently released version of ConfigMgr 1802, it was possible to
perform step-by-step deployment cycles. This is the next step in
automating the maintenance of workplaces based on Windows 10 and Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise.
If the update is deployed to the target group computers
without errors, it is automatically launched for the next group of
employees.

**Intune**\
This tool allows you to deploy and manage software on the service
terminals. With the help of the new Microsoft Kiosk browser, created on
the basis of Microsoft Edge, one or several terminals can safely and
without crashing view web pages in full screen mode.

    Now the function includes a page with the status of the
    installation. It makes sure that the necessary agreements, settings,
    and applications appear on the device during the initial
    installation before the end user is at the screen and starts
    interacting with the device.
