Microsoft "stops
supporting"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/windows-sql-server-2008
Windows Server and SQL Server 2008 and 2008 R2 has been
offered for 10 years (5 years for Mainstream Support and 5 years for
Extended Support) and provided for, among other things, [regular
security updates](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/). After the
end of the Extended Support period, you will not be able to receive
updates, which may cause security and compliance issues and expose
customers' applications and business to serious security risks. We
recommend upgrading these products to the latest versions of Microsoft
software with improved security features, enhanced performance, and
innovative features to help reduce security risks and continue to get
regular security updates. If you do not have time to upgrade your
systems in time, select one of the options to protect applications and
data during the transition period.

#### Option 1 -- Migrate workloads to Azure

Newer, safer, and higher-performing up-to-date software versions support
the installation of regular security updates. If you don't have time to
upgrade to the latest version, transfer your workloads to Azure and
[renew your security
updates](https://www.microsoft.com/en-sa/cloud-platform/extended-security-updates)
for free for three years. The main advantages of this option include:

-   update at your pace and on your terms
-   Azure embedded security features and over 70 certificates of
    conformity
-   save up to 80 percent by using existing Windows Server and
    SQL Server licenses with Azure Hybrid Benefit [Azure
    Hybrid
    Benefit](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/hybrid-benefit/)
    (available to customers with active Software Assurance or Server
    Subscriptions) to obtain discounts on the license of Azure Virtual
    Machines (IaaS) or Azure SQL Database Managed Instance
    (PaaS).

#### Option 2 -- Update your on-premises environments and plan your migration to a hybrid system

Customers running SQL Server or Windows Server under licenses
with active Software Assurance under an Enterprise Agreement (EA),
Enterprise Subscription Agreement (ESA), or a Server & Cloud
Enrollment (SCE) who do not have time to update their
on-premises environment can purchase Extended Security Updates annually
for three years after the End of Support date. Customers can purchase
Extended Security Updates only for the servers they need to cover.
Extended Security Updates can be purchased directly from Microsoft or a
Microsoft licensing partner. Upgrade your system to the OS and data
platform designed specifically for hybrid data centers: Windows Server
2019 and SQL Server 2017.

-   After the end of support, you can purchase Extended Security Updates
    for an additional fee for three years (a valid Software Assurance
    license or a subscription license under the Enterprise Agreement is
    required).
-   Reduce the cost of updates -- pay only for servers that require
    support.

To calculate the cost of migrating workloads to Azure, send your
requests to <sales@itpartner365.com>.

You can [extend security
updates](https://www.microsoft.com/en-sa/cloud-platform/extended-security-updates)
only for Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, SQL
Server 2008, and SQL Server 2008 R2.
