*Please note, to use these new labeling experiences, you must first
configure your organization's sensitivity labels in the Microsoft 365
Security & Compliance Center. Once configured, the labels become
available in supported Office applications. If your organization has
sensitivity labels configured in the Azure portal for Azure Information
Protection, you will first need to migrate your labels to the Security &
Compliance Center*

The Sensitivity drop-down menu makes it easy to view the available
labels and select the appropriate option. The experience is similar
across Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Outlook.

Once a sensitivity label is applied to a document or email, the label
persists with the file, even if it travels to other locations, such as
other devices, apps, or cloud services. Your organization has the
flexibility to customize its policy to apply different actions based on
which label is selected, including encryption, restricting access to the
file, or applying visual markings to the document (such as
headers/footers or a watermark indicating the file is confidential or
contains sensitive information).
