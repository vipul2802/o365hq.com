### Introduction

Azure AD joined devices tenant-to-tenant migration may be necessary when organizations undergo mergers, acquisitions, or reorganizations that require consolidation or separation of their Azure AD environments. 

During the migration process, devices joined with the source Azure AD tenant are un-joined and re-joined with the Azure AD in the target tenant. This process ensures that the devices are fully integrated and managed under the new tenant. 

The Azure AD joined devices tenant-to-tenant migration process requires careful planning and execution to avoid data loss, service disruptions, and security breaches. The migration process involves several steps, including assessment of the current Azure AD environment, preparation of the target Azure AD environment, set up of device management, migration of the devices, verification, and testing, and decommissioning of the source Azure AD environment. 

It is important to note that Azure AD joined devices tenant-to-tenant migration can be complex, and organizations may need to work with experienced Azure AD consultants or service providers to ensure a smooth and successful migration. 

### Prerequisites 

Before initiating an Azure AD joined devices tenant-to-tenant migration, there are several prerequisites that need to be met to ensure a successful migration: 

1. Both the source and target Azure AD tenants must have valid accounts with appropriate permissions to perform the migration process. 
2. The user accounts must have sufficient permissions to perform actions on Azure AD joined devices, such as unjoining and rejoining devices. 
3. The domain names used in the source and target Azure AD tenants must match to ensure that the migration process is successful. 
4. The device registration information, including device name, domain join status, and Azure AD registration, must be up-to-date to ensure that the migration process is performed correctly. 
5. If an MDM/MAM solution is being used to manage devices, it must be supported in the target Azure AD tenant, and the necessary configurations must be in place. 

### Migration process 

**Step 1. Assess the current environment**

Before initiating the migration process, it is essential to assess the current Azure AD environment to identify the devices that need to be migrated. This includes identifying the number of devices, their location, and any dependencies on other services.

**Step 2. Prepare the target environment**

The target Azure AD environment must be prepared before starting the migration process. This includes creating the necessary user accounts, groups, and policies to ensure a smooth transition. 

**Step 3. Set up device management**

Once the target Azure AD environment is prepared, device management needs to be set up to ensure that the migrated devices can be managed and monitored correctly. 

**Step 4. Migrate devices**

The actual migration process involves moving the Azure AD joined devices from the source tenant to the target tenant. This can be done using various methods, including using PowerShell scripts, or third-party tools. 

**Step 5. Verify and test**

After the devices have been migrated, it is crucial to verify that they are functioning correctly and that all policies and configurations have been applied correctly. It is also essential to test the migrated devices to ensure that they are working as expected. 

**Step 6. Decommission the source environment**

Once the migration is complete and verified, the source Azure AD environment can be decommissioned. It is crucial to ensure that all data and configurations are safely backed up before decommissioning the source environment. 

It is essential to follow the above steps carefully to ensure a successful Azure AD joined devices tenant-to-tenant migration process. 

### Challenges and common issues 

Migrating Azure AD joined devices from one tenant to another can be a complex process that requires careful planning and execution. Here are some common challenges and issues you may encounter during the migration: 

* **Domain Name System (DNS) resolution**. When migrating devices from one tenant to another, DNS resolution can become a problem. This is because the devices may be configured to use the DNS servers of the original tenant, which can cause communication issues with the new tenant. 
Authentication and authorization issues. Azure AD joined devices rely on Azure AD for authentication and authorization. During the migration, devices may not be able to authenticate or authorize properly, leading to access issues and security risks. 
* **Application access issues**. If applications are tied to the original tenant, they may not be available to users after the migration. This can cause productivity issues and user frustration. 
* **Data loss or corruption**. Migrating devices can lead to data loss or corruption if not done properly. It is important to have a backup plan and ensure that data is properly transferred during the migration. 
* **User experience issues**. Users may experience disruptions to their workflow during the migration process. This can lead to frustration and reduced productivity. 

To mitigate these challenges and issues, it is important to plan the migration carefully and follow best practices for Azure AD migration. This includes conducting a thorough inventory of devices, applications, and data, as well as testing the migration process in a non-production environment before executing the actual migration. It is also important to communicate clearly with users about the migration process and provide them with support and resources to minimize disruptions to their workflow.
