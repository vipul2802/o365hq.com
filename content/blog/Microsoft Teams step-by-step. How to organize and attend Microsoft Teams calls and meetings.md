Teams meetings are a great way to come together with your colleagues and clients both inside and outside of your organization. You don’t need to be a member of an organization – or even have a Teams account! – to join a Teams meeting."

Microsoft Teams has clients available for desktop (Windows and Mac),
web, and mobile (Android and iOS). These clients all require an active
internet connection and do not support an offline mode.

### Get Microsoft Teams client

The Microsoft Teams desktop client is a standalone application and
currently not part of Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise. Teams are available for both
Windows (7+), both 32-bit and 64-bit versions, and MacOS (10.10+). On
Windows, Teams requires .NET Framework 4.5 or later; the Teams installer
will offer to install it for you if you don't have it.

**Windows Desktop client** can be downloaded and installed by end users
directly from <https://teams.microsoft.com/downloads> if they have the
appropriate local permissions.

**Mac users** can install Teams by using a PKG installation
file for MacOS computers. Administrative access is required to install
the Mac client. The MacOS client is installed to the /Applications
folder.

Install Teams by using the PKG file

1\. From the Teams [download
page](https://teams.microsoft.com/downloads), under Mac, click
Download.\
2. Double-click the PKG file.\
3. Follow the installation wizard to complete the installation.\
4. Teams will be installed to /Applications folder. It is a machine-wide
installation.

**The web client** (https://teams.microsoft.com) is a full, functional
client that can be used from a variety of browsers. The web client
supports Calling and Meetings by using webRTC, so there is no plug-in or
download required to run Teams in a web browser. The browser must be
configured to allow third-party cookies.

### Set up a meeting

In Teams, there are two ways to initiate real-time communication.

1. A user can call another user directly.

2. A user can create a meeting (ad hoc or scheduled). For calls, the media
(audio, video, or desktop or application sharing) travel as directly as
possible. If, for example, there's no firewall between two users (for
example, both sit inside the same network), media traffic travels
directly from one user to the other. If a firewall blocks direct traffic
between the users, the traffic will be sent via a relay.

### Schedule a meeting in Teams

To schedule a meeting, click *Schedule a meeting* in a chat or in
*Meetings* on the left side of the app.

Go to the *Select a channel to meet* section.

-   If you want to have your meeting in a channel, select the
    appropriate channel.
-   If you'd rather not, select *None*.

#### Schedule a Teams meeting from Outlook

Microsoft Teams includes the Outlook add-in, which lets you create new
Teams meetings directly from Outlook. It also lets people view, accept,
or join meetings in either app.

Add your invitees to the *To* field; you can even invite entire contact
groups (formerly known as distribution lists). Add your meeting subject,
location, start time and end time. Then click *Send*.

When you schedule a meeting in the desktop or web app, use the
*Invite people* box to search for and invite people. Then, you can use
the scheduling assistant to see times when everyone is free.

When you're in a meeting, you can see the people who were invited but
haven't joined. To send someone a reminder to join the meeting, click on
their profile picture and choose *Call into the meeting*.

If you're in a meeting, you can also click *Add people* to add someone
who was previously not invited.

#### Join a meeting in Teams

If you use a mobile device, both before and during the meeting, you'll
see the meeting notice in your chat list or a channel conversation.

You can join from that meeting notice or from the *Meetings* calendar.

On the desktop are several ways to join a meeting in Teams.

**From your calendar**

Click *Meetings* on the left side of the app and you'll see a list of
all your meetings for the week. Find the meeting you want, and then
click *Join*.

**From chat**

If the meeting has already begun, it appears in your recent chat list.
Select the meeting in your chat list and then click *Join* from the chat
header.

**From a notification**

If you're busy in Teams, you'll receive a notification that you've been
invited to a meeting, and you can click *Join* there.

**From a channel**

If a meeting is happening in a channel, you'll see an invitation to
join, relevant content, and who's in the meeting. If the meeting is
scrolled out of view in the conversation, you'll get a notification in
the channel. Just click Join to choose your settings and join the
meeting.

**From Outlook**

You can also join a meeting from a calendar invite in Outlook. If you
click the link in your email invite, you'll be directed to Teams and can
join your meeting from there.

### Tips

#### Screen sharing

Lets you present your screen or a file during a meeting. To share your
screen in a meeting, select More options \> Share in your meeting
controls. You can choose to present a PowerPoint, photo, video, or your
entire screen.

#### Share PowerPoint slides in a meeting

If you choose to share a PowerPoint file in a meeting rather than your
desktop, meeting participants will get some special capabilities.

1.  They'll be able to move around to different slides without
    interrupting the main presentation.
2.  They can sync their view back to the presenter's view with one
    click.
    1.  Click *Share* in your meeting controls.
    2.  In the *PowerPoint* section, click the file you want. Click
        *Browse* to look for a different file.

#### Give and take control of a sharing session

**Give control**

If you want another meeting participant to change a file, help you
present, or demonstrate something, you can give control to that person.
You will both be in control of the sharing, and you can take back
control anytime.

1. On the sharing toolbar, select *Give control*.\
2. Select the name of the person you want to give control to.

Teams sends a notification to that person to let them know you're sharing
control. While you're sharing control, they can make selections, edits,
and other modifications to the shared screen.

3. To take control back, select *Take back control*.

**Take control**

To take control while another person is sharing, select *Request
control*. The person sharing will approve or deny your request.\
While you have control, you can make selections, edits, and other
modifications to the shared screen.

When you're done, select *Release control* to stop sharing control.

4. Blur your background in a Teams meeting

https://8gportalvhdsf9v440s15hrt.blob.core.windows.net/ignite2018/img/Teams%20-%20Blue%20your%20background.gif

Not happy with your backdrop in a video meeting? Try background blur.
You'll appear nice and clear while everything behind you is subtly
concealed.

To start a meeting with background blur, move the blur slider -- the one
to the right of the video slider -- to the right on the *Choose your
audio and video settings* screen when you're joining the meeting.
FYI, this only works for scheduled meetings.

To turn on background blur during a meeting, click *More options* \>
Blur my background.

#### Take meeting notes in Teams

To take notes before a meeting, go to *Meetings* on the left side of the
app, select the meeting, and click *Chat with participants*. Select the
*Meeting Notes tab*, then click *Start taking meeting notes*.

Add the agenda or other important discussion points. \@mention people to
get their attention or assign action items.\
Once you're in the meeting, click *Meeting Notes* in the upper right
corner. If you have not taken any notes yet, click *Start taking meeting
notes*.

Otherwise, start typing your notes. Use the controls at the top of the
panel to format and layout the text. To add a new note, click *Add a new
section here*. Use \@mentions to draw someone's attention to a specific
note or assign an action item.

**After the meeting**

Go to the channel where the meeting occurred (or the meeting chat for a
private meeting) and find the meeting. Beneath it, click Show notes in
fullscreen.
