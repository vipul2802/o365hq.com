If you are a sales representative and you spend most of your day on the
sales floor assisting customers, *Sales Buddy Solution* is a good choice
for you. It is a mobile-friendly app built with *Microsoft PowerApps*,
used to manage both your company products and customers, as needed.

Using the Sales Buddy app, you have a few different ways you can search
for a product -- by category, by keyword, or by the barcode.

Once you select a product within the app, you can view all the
information about the product, including *SKU* and *Barcode*,
and add it to the Saved Products list. It is easy to see when the next
shipment will arrive, and if the stock is low.

Sales Buddy gives you the ability to add new customers into Dynamics 365
when needed. It is simple to add them to your company's mailing list,
opting to receive targeted email campaigns, while also creating new
opportunities within Dynamics 365 for you and your team to follow up on.

Just like products, it is possible to search for existing customers in a
few different ways -- by *Name*, *Email*, *Company*, or *Phone number*.\
And just like products, customer information from the back end is
integrated into the app, providing you with an optimized experience,
enabling you to do your job while leveraging the data and systems you
already have.

You can review the product selection together with a customer and add
additional recipients, if needed.

To ensure everyone on your team follows up on a new opportunity, the
CRM system is updated accordingly. The Sales Buddy app will
create *new opportunities* within the customer record, knowing what the
customer might be interested in buying.

Once you complete the email details, you can copy yourself on the email
and send it to the customer.

The automatically generated email message includes all the product
details seen within the app, and includes a generated signature so the
customer knows who they are working with.

The Sales Buddy app has proven to be the best way to manage your product
and customer information. You have data from multiple sources right at
your fingertips -- Dynamics 365 and Microsoft 365 -- empowering you to do
your job more efficiently, all from the sales floor.

### Building the solution on the web

The web studio doesn't look like a developer environment at all! With
multiple screens and multiple components, the web studio looks a lot
like PowerPoint, making navigation and customization of any app an easy
process.

PowerApps has built-in connections to a wide variety of data sources.
These connection options ensure that users can build apps against data
that already exists within their organization. The Sales Buddy app is
connected to Dynamics 365 and Microsoft 365.

It is always possible to connect to other data sources. There are more
than 230 data connectors to choose from, including Adobe Sign, Facebook,
GitHub, LinkedIn, and many more. This helps to break down silos,
resulting in a highly productive app.

All PowerApps controls have referenceable properties. For example, users
can modify size, color, position, display text, and many other
properties. Values for these properties can be fixed at design time.
Alternatively, these values can be dynamic, using Excel-like expressions.

The Sales Buddy app has an editable form control that allows users to
update the Dynamics 365 records shown when searching for a customer's
contact details.

In the Edit pane to the right, you can edit the fields within the form.
Here, it is possible to add additional fields, such as a telephone
number. Adding or modifying editable controls for fields is as simple as
selecting or clearing check boxes in this area.\
The Power Platform enables organizations to build enterprise-grade web
and mobile apps right where the business happens, providing innovation
without limits while staying within the boundaries and management set by
IT.
