Advanced Threat Protection helps protect your organization from
malicious attacks by:\

-   Scanning attachments and hyperlinks in email messages and
    attachments
-   Identifying and blocking malicious files in SharePoint Online,
    OneDrive for Business, and Microsoft Teams
-   Checking email messages for unauthorized spoofing
-   Detecting when someone attempts to impersonate your users and your
    organization's custom domains

Microsoft added new feature to ATP: Real-time reports.

Previously, we had to wait a few days to see the statistics. Now you can
watch ATP work online!

To view this report, in the *Security & Compliance Center*, go to
*Reports* \> *Dashboard* \> and select *Threat protection* status.
