### Configure sensitivity labels and DLP policy

Configuring DLP policies will help you block the accidental
loss of confidential information. It is easy to create an encryption
policy while creating the label or add it later. Only the
users and groups selected will be assigned permissions to use the
content that has this label applied. Enabling content marking, you can
add custom headers, footers, and watermarks to the content that has this
label applied.

During the final review of the settings, you can edit specific settings
or choose to create the label. After the label is created, settings can
still be edited, and the label can be published or deleted. The user can
employ the label right after it has been created and configured.

Office 365 DLP policies will help you stay relevant and match business 
standards, keep the data protected, and prevent accidental
oversharing and leakage. DLP allows you to easily detect
sensitive data across various locations and control policy violations
for further investigation. It provides locations for storing your data,
conditions for applying policy, and ways of defending the content.

### Native sensitivity labeling in Office apps across platforms

Microsoft is improving the data protection experience for its end users
by making it simple to add sensitivity labels to their documents and
emails. The easier it is to do, the more likely they are to classify
data correctly. This service has been embedded into Office apps across
platforms, and all the sensitivity labels exist on the Sensitivity
button, on the Home tab, and on the Ribbon.

When collaborating with your colleagues on a document using your
corporate MacBook, you're going to use Office for Mac. Right within Word
on Mac you can use the new, built-in label picker to easily select
the right label that's appropriate for the document.

Like Word, in Excel you can use the new, natively integrated label
picker to easily select the right label that's right for this document.
Using the drop-down menu, you can apply the "Confidential-Finance" label.

When the email is sent, the receiver will see that the email is
protected. The header of the email contains information indicating that
it is confidential. The header information displayed can be customized
by IT admins.

There is also the Sensitivity button that allows you to employ the
different labels in Office apps on iOS devices. As you use different
labels, the watermark reflects the one you have selected. Selecting
labels is the same within apps on a platform. When using PowerPoint, you
see the same sets of labels as you did in Word. Initially, the document
has no labels applied.

Labels are applied very consistently across platforms. No matter what
platform you're using, the appropriate permissions and watermarks will
be applied.

### Send a protected email to an external user

Nowadays, people tend to exchange various sensitive data via
emails. As a result, their mailboxes turn into repositories for large
amounts of confidential information, and its leakage can become a serious
threat to your company.

*Office 365 Message Encryption* is used across a variety of services. It
enables you to send a secure email to everyone inside and outside the
company. Recipients can easily read and respond to messages protected by
Office 365 Message Encryption, regardless of the email provider they use.

To send a protected message to a Gmail user, you will have to create
policies that enforce encryption on all email messages sent to external
recipients. Then, all the new messages composed to an external recipient
will be automatically protected.

Gmail is not RMS-aware, so when a user receives the message,
it's wrapped in another email that provides instructions on how to read
it.

If you are using Gmail, there is an option of using the new federated
sign-in experience to read the message. When you sign in with your
Gmail credentials, the message is displayed.

And no matter what email provider the recipient uses, they can always
read an encrypted message by requesting a one-time key.

### Prevent sharing of sensitive data with Office 365 Data Loss Prevention

To stay up to date and follow all the industry rules, companies need to
keep sensitive data safe. *DLP policy* helps you analyze
confidential information through Office 365, avoid its inadvertent
disclosure, and ensure its security in the desktop versions of Excel,
PowerPoint, and Word.

You can use DLP to allow the blockage of sensitive data
contained in chats and channel conversations. When a message is sent, it
is inspected for sensitive data in near real-time.

Policy tips inform the sender of the reason why the message is blocked
and allow end users to revoke it. This is very important for companies
that use Microsoft Teams to boost their workforce collaboration and
increase their production capacity, as they are provided with a great
way to provide appropriate control and management of their data.

### Protect sensitive files in third-party cloud services

A lot of data lives in cloud services and SaaS apps. Microsoft
Information Protection makes it easy to discover, analyze, and safeguard
your information that resides in cloud services. This leverages the
classification methods and sensitivity labels used in other Microsoft
information protection services.

It is possible to create a file policy using Microsoft Cloud App
Security that enables content with specific keywords or sensitivity
types to be labeled and protected.

Your company can use a cloud service storage, such as Box, to store and
share some of your confidential documents. When a file is uploaded to a
third-party service that contains the keywords or matches sensitive
information types, the label will be automatically applied.

Microsoft solutions work together to keep your confidential information
safe and secure, even if it is stored in the cloud.

### Protect sensitive information on Windows 10 devices

Protecting sensitive information is no longer limited to on-premises
devices that are centrally managed and controlled. More and more,
company data also resides on personal PCs and devices owned by
employees.

Windows Information Protection helps protect sensitive data on Windows
10 devices against accidental leakage through apps, cloud services, and
social media.

Windows understands sensitivity labels in documents and can use that
information to enforce policy.

When you download a document from OneDrive, the Windows Information
Protection policy is enforced based on sensitivity labels, which
means blocking or controlling the copying or transfer of information
from this labeled document to other apps and locations on the device.

If you want to share some exciting information with your followers on
Twitter, you can easily open the document using Microsoft Word, which is
an approved work app. Note that the downloaded file still has the
Confidential label, as it did in OneDrive. You simply copy the text and
paste it into a new tweet.

Windows Information Protection is used to ensure that labeled and
protected files preserve their protection when being copied to removable
storage, like a USB drive, or block copying to cloud locations,
such as OneDrive for Business or other cloud repositories.
