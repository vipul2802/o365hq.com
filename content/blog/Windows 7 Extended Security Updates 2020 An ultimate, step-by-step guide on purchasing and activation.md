We will help you get those elusive and hard-to-find Windows 7 Extended
Security Updates for your computers.

Please follow the steps listed below to make sure you purchase the right
product for your device(s).

***NOTE***:

The original price for Win 7 ESU was \$50. But on Dec 10, 2019,
it was increased to \$62. We got this communication from Microsoft:

> UPDATE: Windows 7 ESU in CSP -- Pricing On
> December 2, Windows 7 Extended Security Updates (ESU) were
> made available to businesses of all sizes through Cloud Solution
> Provider (CSP). We have identified a price discrepancy with
> the Windows 7 Extended Security Updates available through the
> CSP channel. As of Tuesday, December 10, we have fixed the
> discrepancy to ensure that all commercial customers have the same
> suggested retail price for the Windows 7 ESU. Now, the
> ESU price that CSP partners see will align to the
> pricing offered through our volume licensing channel since April
> 2019."

### Verify if your edition of Windows 7 is eligible for ESU

1.  Select *the Start button*, type *Computer* in the search box,
    right-click on *Computer*, and then select *Properties*.\

2.  Under Windows edition, you'll see the version and edition of Windows
    that your device is running. ESU are available for
    **Windows 7 Professional**, **Windows 7 Enterprise** and **Windows 7
    Ultimate**.

### Verify that you have all the Windows 7 Updates installed

1.  Open the Windows Control Panel, and then click System and Security.\

4.  Allow for updates to download and install, and then check for new
    updates again to make sure there are no new updates.

### Make sure all your Windows 7 computers that need to be ESU-enabled are connected to the Internet.

ESU MAK Phone activation was recently added as an
option for non-Internet-connected devices. This article doesn't describe
that activation process.

### Check the instructions below and decide if you will be able to install and activate the Win7ESU keys yourself.

-   If yes -- please skip this step.
-   If no -- reserve about \$49 per PC for [Windows 7 ESU
    Remote Installation
    Service](https://buymssoft.com/directlink?q=_ITPWW240CONOT.1).
    Internet connectivity is required.

### Purchase the required number of licenses using [this link](https://buymssoft.com/license/CSP-DG7GMGF0FL73-0002).

A Microsoft 365 / Azure AD tenant name will be required to place an order for
ESU licenses. It's ok if you don't have one. We will register a
tenant for you. It's free, and there are no strings attached. If you have a
tenant and want to use it -- make sure you complete the questionnaire
after you place your order.

Usually, it takes about a day to process an ESU order. When an
order is processed, you will receive an email with a MAK (Multiple
Activation Key).

### Check your mailbox and Junk Mail folder for an email from us with the activation key.

Depending on what office process the order, the email with the key may
come from one of the following domain names:
o365hq.com OR itpartner365.com.

When you have the key, you are ready for the next step.

### Install and activate ESU on your Windows 7 computers

    Licensing Management Tool (slmgr):
    1.  Open an elevated Command Prompt.
        1.  Click Start
        2.  In the search box, type **cmd**.
        3.  Right-click on **cmd.exe** and choose Run as Administrator.

            opens.
        4.  Click Yes to run the **Windows Command Prompt** as
            Administrator.
    2.  Type **slmgr /ipk** and enter your ESU MAK key
        and press Enter. Make sure you have spaces between slmgr and
        /ipk and your MAK key. Your slmg command should look
        like this: **slmgr /ipk A7B6D-N3D1F-J34ND-LP3NA-32BNA**
    3.  If the product key installed successfully, after a short delay,
        you will see a message similar to the following:\

    3.  It should be 77db037b-95c3-48d7-a3ab-a9c6d41093e0. It's the

    3.  Once you have activated the ESU product key, you can
        verify the status at any time by following these steps:
        1.  Open an elevated Command Prompt.
        2.  Type **slmgr /dlv** and select Enter.
        3.  Verify Licensed Status shows as Licensed for the

        through Windows Update, Windows Server Update Services
        ([WSUS]{.caps}), Microsoft Update Catalog, or whichever patch
        management solution you prefer. You will receive updates until
        the end of 2020.
