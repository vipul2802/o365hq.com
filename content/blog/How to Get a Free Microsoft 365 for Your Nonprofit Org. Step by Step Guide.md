## Get Microsoft 365 Business Premium for your Nonprofit Organization. For free!

Securely run and grow your nonprofit with an integrated solution
purpose-built for small and midsized organizations.

Available today, we are providing up to 10 donated seats and discounted
pricing at \$5 per user/month for additional users of our integrated
cloud solution Microsoft 365 Business that brings together the
best-in-class productivity of Microsoft 365 (including Office desktop
applications), Windows Professional, and advanced security and device
management capabilities to help nonprofits securely run and grow their
organizations. Nonprofits can obtain additional seats for just \$5 per
additional user per month. Through our Microsoft partner ecosystem
around the world, we'll be fueling scale and the ability for every
nonprofit to move to the cloud.

Get started at
[Microsoft.com/Nonprofits](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Nonprofits).

### Step 1

To take advantage of a nonprofit offer, you need to [register your
organization](https://nonprofit.microsoft.com/register) through
Microsoft using their
[https://nonprofit.microsoft.com](https://nonprofit.microsoft.com/register)
website.

IMPORTANT: During registration, you will create a Microsoft account,
called a
[Tenant](https://o365hq.com/faq/what-is-office-365-or-azure-ad-tenant).
It would be a default commercial tenant not eligible for nonprofit
discounts UNTIL Microsoft verifies your eligibility. You will receive an
email in 3-5 days from Microsoft with approval, and then your tenant
would be tagged as a Nonprofit tenant. Only then you would be able to
request your free Microsoft 365 Business Premium licenses.

During this quick registration process, you will need to provide proof
of your organization's eligibility (tax identification number or
registered documentation from government entities, like a charity
commission), as described on the
[Eligibility](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/nonprofits/eligibility?activetab=pivot1%3aprimaryr4)
page.

(*Please note, the person completing registration will be the Global
Administrator of the account by default. You can add additional
administrators in the Admin Center once your account is established*).

### Step 2

Wait for the approval email to arrive. It should look something like
this one below:

![](https://o365hq.com/images/779.png)

Please forward this email to us at sales\@o365hq.com. We will need to
know your tenant name to provision your free Microsoft 365 Business
Premium subscriptions.

You may visit the same page to check the status of your application.
Make sure you log in using your Microsoft 365 Global Admin credentials you
created during Step 1. As you can see -- Microsoft reserves up to 20
days to make a decision. But usually, it's about 3-5 days.

### Step 3

Authorize **IT Partner** to provision licenses into your tenant by
clicking on [this
link](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?invType=IndirectResellerRelationship&partnerId=4ed6ea8d-6f86-411d-b7e0-37401bdb9b68&msppId=4100178&indirectCSPId=d5c77776-8b4c-4ceb-81da-566aba9c59c5&DAP=true#/BillingAccounts/partner-invitation).
Make sure you have signed in using your Microsoft 365 account with Global
Admin permissions before clicking on this link.

### Step 4

Even if your chosen licenses are free, we must have information about your
organization to place the order with Microsoft. So, please complete this
[New Customer Application](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=jerWToZvHUG34DdAG9ubaGbNn0XlEsdGmwZuhYBTb1tUQkMwMzdVSDdZOUgzQUgzWTVPQUVMMzFZNi4u)
form:

[![](https://o365hq.com/img/msforms.png)](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=jerWToZvHUG34DdAG9ubaGbNn0XlEsdGmwZuhYBTb1tUQkMwMzdVSDdZOUgzQUgzWTVPQUVMMzFZNi4u)

Please skip the question about your default domain name if you have
forwarded a Microsoft Nonprofit Eligibility Certificate email to us.
Otherwise, please provide your [default
domain](https://o365hq.com/faq/how-to-find-our-your-office-365-default-domain-name)
name on this form.

### Step 5

Wait for an email confirmation that your licenses have been provisioned.
To verify that you have your subscriptions, please go and review your
[Billing -\>
Licenses](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?source=applauncher#/licenses)
page inside your Microsoft 365 Admin Center.

### Step 6

You just got your Microsoft 365, and now you need to use it so you can
start reading emails, sharing documents, and more. [Educate your
users](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/admin-overview/get-started-with-office-365)
on how to set up and use Microsoft 365 on their computers, smartphones,
and tablets. Also, explore resources for working in the [Microsoft 365
admin center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/?view=o365-worldwide).

As a very minimum, you'd like to do the following:

1.  [Add a domain to Microsoft
    365](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/setup/add-domain?view=o365-worldwide)
2.  [Add users and assign licenses at the same

    Online](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/mailbox-migration/mailbox-migration)

5.  [Set up multi-factor
    authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/set-up-multi-factor-authentication?view=o365-worldwide)
6.  Instruct users to [Install desktop Office Apps on their PCs or Mac
    computers](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/download-and-install-or-reinstall-microsoft-365-or-office-2019-on-a-pc-or-mac-4414eaaf-0478-48be-9c42-23adc4716658)
7.  Instruct users to [Set up Office apps and email on their mobile
    devices](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/set-up-office-apps-and-email-on-a-mobile-device-7dabb6cb-0046-40b6-81fe-767e0b1f014f)

### Step 7
