Microsoft Search was introduced to address common search related issues.

1.  An explosion of internet and intranet content -- more content is now
    available across the enterprise and online.
2.  The enterprise search experience hasn't changed in the past 10 years --
    it's still serving lots of blue links, but lacking tools to
    differentiate between them.
3.  In general, search wasn't really helping users accomplish tasks --
    just navigate through the surfaced links.

Microsoft Search breaks the enterprise search mold by offering users:

-   better, more contextual results
-   a richer, more consistent and organized user experience
-   quick access to information needed to accomplish key tasks

All Microsoft products are making a bold bet on the importance of search
by putting the Microsoft Search box in the header across the Microsoft
365 suite of applications. Microsoft Search is proactive, contextual,
and coherent. Microsoft Search leverages advanced computing technologies,
like deep learning for better semantic understanding of search queries.
Semantic understanding allows people to search for information using the
natural language and phrases we speak every day, whether typed into a
search field in an application or spoken to a virtual assistant.

Microsoft has improved Search to achieve better results across work and
life. Great results start with a great place to start your search, and
*Bing* delivers a stunning, high-definition image daily. The Bing home
page is also a high-performance page optimized for use as a blank start
page.

Microsoft has embedded a Bing homepage quiz hotspot into the image to
help consumers learn about the image context in detail -- there is a
hidden multiple-choice question based upon the image of the day on the
bottom right of the screen.

Answering the question opens a relevant search results page where you
can find out if your answer was correct and explore related content for a
deeper understanding. Bing also provides quick access to recent homepage
images, and interesting facts related to this day in history.

Microsoft Search is a new search experience that retrieves information
from a school or organization, like files and company data, and displays
them in a single, unified experience.

Microsoft Search understands your intent and the kind of information you
are likely looking for by integration with the *Microsoft Graph*. It
boosts your capacity and delivers search results from your workplace.

While at work, you can explore the intelligence of Microsoft Search to
access information within Microsoft 365. Microsoft Search's results include
local and organizational content. Whether searching for people, office
locations, or files, you can easily find it all in *Microsoft 365*.

Search and discovery tools make people and content more accessible and
allow you to gain a broad view of contextual information across your
company.

It is simple to reach out to your colleagues by clicking on their
contact card to quickly send an email, chat, or call with Outlook,
Teams, or Skype for Business, and find the location of their office for
a face-to-face conversation.

Intelligent file recommendations powered by Microsoft Search are based
on the Microsoft Graph and its understanding of how people work, who
they work with, and activity in content shared with them across
Microsoft 365. With intelligent file recommendations, users get
suggestions they are more likely to click on than those surfaced by
rule-based algorithms like the most recently used files.

However, Microsoft Search is more than just files. Enhanced people
search lets you identify the right people in your company by using
attributes, such as designer, to provide answers or help quickly. The
deep, contextual information returned by Microsoft Search helps you boost
your productivity and reduces the friction of switching between apps and
browser tabs.

In the near future, Microsoft will enable hero search scenarios, such as
"skill" or "subject matter expert" by making this part of the underlying
platform that powers Microsoft Search and the search capabilities of
*Microsoft Assistant*. The breadth of Microsoft Search lets you
immediately find relevant information across the web and your company,
surfacing that content where you are actively working.

SharePoint mobile app helps you stay updated while away from your
computer. Even on mobile, the search experience is intuitive and
delivers the same great results.

Microsoft Search presents a consistently integrated experience across
the entire portfolio of Microsoft's applications and empowers people by
intelligently finding relevant content quickly, both on the web and
across an organization. Search wherever you are -- you'll get the same
great results and experience, secured for the enterprise.
