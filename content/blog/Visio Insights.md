### Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams provides a central hub for conversations, documents,
data, and resources that everyone uses to do their job. *The
Conversations* tab keeps team members in touch with what they're working
on and enables them to share information and documents.

*The Files* tab helps everyone stay on the same page with the latest
sales numbers, marketing collateral, and sales documents. Visio is a
great tool for visualizing and communicating complex processes.

Power BI dashboard in Teams will give you a look at how your team is
performing right now, including revenue against target and the status of
those leads. Here you can also look at individual opportunities, check
on their status, and filter data by sales stage.

### Visio in Power BI

The Power BI dashboard is great for keeping up on the sales
KPIs, but you can always go deeper. Using Power BI and
Microsoft Visio enables you to visualize the performance of the sales
journey, right in Power BI. The Visio visual for Power BI makes it
easy to embed shared Visio diagrams into Power BI and gain highly visual
insights into data.

Adding Visio to your Power BI dashboard lets you associate it with a
data table that captures performance KPIs related to the sales
process. With Visio, you can visualize this process alongside the data
that's relevant to it. This control gives you the ability to view the
visual in multiple ways.

This visualization is great, but in order to get the insights you are
looking for, you need to connect it with live data. The *Field Mapping*
pane allows you to control how each data field is shown on the page.
Visio and Power BI automatically bind the sales data to the diagram,
but you can also do this manually or make adjustments.

You can always share your dashboard with the team so they can use it to
track their efforts in the future.

Power BI, Visio, and Teams make it easy for you to share your insights,
giving your team members valuable information that's presented in the
context of work, continuously updated to reflect the latest reality.
Back in Microsoft Teams, the pinned dashboard is automatically updated
with the diagram.

Microsoft Visio helps organizations visualize complex information and
derive actionable insights.
