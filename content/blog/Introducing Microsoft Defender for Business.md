#### What is the difference between Microsoft Defender for Business and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint?

Defender for Business brings the enterprise-grade capabilities of Defender for Endpoint to small and medium-sized businesses. [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/?view=o365-worldwide) (Previously Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection) is an enterprise endpoint security platform designed to help enterprise networks prevent, detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats. It is a comprehensive security solution for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and even network devices, such as routers. Defender for Endpoint offers vulnerability management, endpoint protection, endpoint detection and response (EDR), mobile threat defense, and managed hunting all in a single, unified platform. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint offers post-breach detection, automated investigation, and response for devices in your organization. It is available in two plans, Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 and Plan 2.

**Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 (P1)** is available as a standalone user subscription license for commercial and education customers. It is also included as part of Microsoft 365 E3/A3.

**Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 (P2)** is available as a standalone license and as part of the following plans:

* Windows 11 Enterprise E5/A5.
* Windows 10 Enterprise E5/A5.

Both Defender for Business and Defender for Endpoint provide strong threat protection capabilities for your company's endpoints. Defender for Business has basically the same functionality of Defender for Endpoint P1. One of the most distinguishing factors between Defender for Business and Defender for Endpoint is that Defender for Business was specifically designed for small and medium-sized businesses (up to 300 employees). With a simplified configuration process and device onboarding options, Defender for Business enables customers who don't necessarily have a security background to set up, configure, and use Defender for Business to protect company devices.
