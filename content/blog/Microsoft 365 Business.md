Microsoft 365 Business is a complete, integrated solution powered by
Office 365 and Windows 10 designed to help securely run and grow
businesses. Get more done with intelligent tools built into the Office
you love, along with enterprise-grade email and file storage.

Outlook has a rich, immersive interface and enterprise grade email
features like a focused view of the inbox that prioritizes important
emails. You can focus on communications that deserve your attention and
respond faster without being bogged down by clutter. You even get a 50
GB mailbox in Microsoft 365 Business, so you don't have to work within
the constraints of a small mailbox and delete important emails. You can
reply, forward the message, or even reply all with a meeting.

With a single click, Outlook conveniently sets you up with a meeting, and
it even chooses the first available time that is free for you and your
customer! Usually the main scheduling hassle is spending time figuring
out when all the parties are free.

Even if Outlook has chosen a certain time, it is always possible to
change this to another day and again Outlook automatically picks a time
that is convenient to both. This feature easily saves you time and
effort by automatically finding the available time slot, allowing you to
triage your actions faster.

You can easily check your calendar right from your mailbox. It has
intelligent features built in, like location and weather. It is simple to
add multiple calendars to get a consolidated view.

### Work better together

Work better together with Microsoft Teams and collaborate as a group
with co-workers, customers, and suppliers. Microsoft Teams is ideal for
working in a group. Typically, group members have trouble keeping track
of all the various threads. It gets hard to track this over email. Also,
the documents are scattered.

For example, say Megan has created a team site that acts as a central 
repository for all launch activities, so her team has a single workspace to access and
view content. Design channel allows you to see what the design team has
been up to, thanks to the persistent chat feature. This is also a great
feature for when new members join the team. They can easily see previous
conversations and get up to speed quickly.

Teams enables a free flow of conversation where the design team can
collaborate and trade ideas in a single persistent chat. Teams is also
perfect for light-hearted banter, with its support for GIFs and
stickers.

Another great Teams feature is that all team members can access their
files in a single place, which saves time and enables collaboration.
Instead of emailing each other documents, Teams serves as a central
repository for documents that are current and synchronized so everybody
can work off the same document.

It is easy to add and integrate other apps in a team to make the
workflow richer. For example, you can add the OneNote app to take notes,
or add forms if you want to conduct a poll or survey. The team has added
OneNote to track notes from previous design reviews. You can use this to
catch up on the meetings that have taken place.

Team members can even schedule online meetings and conferencing in
Teams. With a few clicks, you can invite an entire group to a meeting,
for example, Megan scheduling a design review with her design team. All you do
is choose the channel and voila, a meeting is added to the calendars of
all design channel members, making it easier to meet as a group. You
don't have to type each name individually. Once the meeting is created, a
meeting link is automatically sent, so all attendees have a conference
bridge they can click on to attend. No need to remember any conference
ID or anything. Just a click to enter.

Teams also includes one-on-one chat, where users can privately chat on
team matters. With Teams chat functionality, you can easily elevate the
conversation into a phone call.

Teams is a single hub that brings together people, groups, and content.
With the ability to chat, access files, and even get on calls, Teams is a
great application that enhances and simplifies collaboration needs.

### Grow your business

Business-specific apps like Bookings are designed to help businesses
grow by improving the efficiency of your operations, attracting new
customers, and maintaining relationships with the customers you already
have. You can use the Bookings app, available in Microsoft 365 Business,
to effectively manage your business and view your customer appointments
for weeks.

This is a typical Bookings page that businesses can set up for their
customers to use. On the Bookings page, it is possible to set up a
simple and familiar web-facing page, which simplifies how customers book
and manage appointments with your business.

You can easily create, customize, and publish an online booking page
where new and returning customers can schedule business services 24/7.\
You can also configure scheduling policies, staff, services, and prices
quickly from one location.

All bookings made by customers on the online page are added to the staff
calendar and updates sent to customers and staff as they are made.

### Safeguard your business

Microsoft 365 Business safeguards businesses by protecting companies
against external threats, like phishing and malicious emails. With
Advanced Threat Protection built into Microsoft 365 Business, every
link and every attachment is scanned and checked. When you click the
suspicious link, you are prevented from accessing a suspicious website.
The service checks every link on your behalf, every time. Advanced Threat
Protection also scans every attachment for suspicious content using
AI-powered analysis and discards suspicious content before it reaches a
mailbox.

![](https://o365hq.com/images/530.png)

It's not just external threats that you must monitor, it's also
important to transmit sensitive information securely. It is
possible to encrypt the entire message so a recipient receives it
securely and must take certain actions to open it. Such user-initiated
information protection features again shows the enterprise-grade
security features built into Microsoft 365 Business.

### On device mobile security

You can easily access your work apps on your device, including emails,
files, or team, and you have a chance to respond on the go with Outlook,
OneDrive, and the Teams app.

If you check into your *OneDrive* app to access your files, you are
immediately asked for a *PIN password*. This Microsoft 365
Business security feature prevents unauthorized access at the app level
in case a device is unlocked and is in the wrong hands.

![](https://o365hq.com/images/533.png)

Microsoft 365 Business security also restricts your ability to copy or
save this document to an unauthorized app. For example, if you wanted to
save this document with credit card numbers to a non-Microsoft
365 Business app, the system prevents you from doing so.

Similarly, if you try to cut or copy and paste to the iOS notes app or
to Gmail, information protection prevents you from doing so.

You can also try to send from your non-work email, pasting this content
into the email, and again the system prevents you from pasting sensitive
content.

And finally, you are limited on where you can save the content. This is
how robust Microsoft 365 Business's information protection is.
Information is secure on the go.

### Mobile data protection -- simplified for you

The mobile device protection features are easily set up in seconds using
the Microsoft 365 Business Setup Wizard. One is right to wonder if
enabling all these productivity features is complex. That's why setup is
simplified with the Microsoft 365 Business console, where you can easily
set up the security policies with simple toggle buttons. You can protect
works files and set up the Office Mobile device policy -- easily
enabling the toggle button to put a PIN policy in place.

![](https://o365hq.com/images/531.png)

The Microsoft 365 Business Setup Wizard simplifies Windows 10 device
set up using security policies that you can easily enable for all users,
like Windows Defender, so individual users cannot disable the antivirus on
their machines and make the organization unsafe.

Microsoft 365 Business is a single subscription that provides businesses
with collaboration, security, and easy device management. The
integration of features is seamless, giving users a delightful
experience.
