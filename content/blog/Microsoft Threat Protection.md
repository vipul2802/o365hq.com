### User-reported phish

The Automated Incident Response (AIR) functionality helps
enhance the admin experience. Threat information updates right away,
providing the latest threat details across your environment.

There can be thousands or tens of thousands of phish emails in your
environment each day. It is a daunting and time-consuming task if a
SecOps team tries to deal with each one of those emails as single
alerts. AIR takes the bulk of these alerts and investigates and
provides actionable recommendations, making the SecOp's day-to-day life
easier. Microsoft Threat Protection AIR is also designed for
security readers to have access to the automated investigations as well.

SecOps engineers can use the Microsoft 365 Security & Compliance portal,
and then navigate to the Alerts dashboard. Microsoft has made it simple
to navigate to the alert page and examine the alerts directly. The
Report Message add-in for Outlook and Outlook on the web enables people
to easily report suspicious email, whether safe or malicious, to
Microsoft for analysis. This information surfaces in the Security
Dashboard and other reports. The organization uses these submissions to
review and update security policies.

The system can investigate several different items based on one email.
It is possible to re-sort by entity type so you can see the different
pieces that it's been looking at from the email. The Microsoft Threat
Protection engine analyzes a massive number of emails and groups them
based on similarities. They may contain the same content, subject, or
come from the same IP address. AIR analyzes the URLs,
the IPs, as well as the sending domain. With this built-in intelligence,
even if the attacker happens to have changed the sender address, changed
the subjects of the emails, or changed the sending infrastructure,
AIR is still able to find those bad URLs in the
environment.

AIR also analyzes the users. If the system identifies a
malicious URL click associated with the user, you can click
into the evidence tab to find out more about this user. This will give
you context about who they are and what's been going on with them
recently within Microsoft 365. SecOps should follow up with this user and
investigate further. This integration of Microsoft 365 Advanced Threat
Protection with MCAS helps provide an organization extensive
visibility into the threat landscape. This comprehensive protection is a
key differentiator for Microsoft Threat Protection.

### Clicked URL verdict changed to malicious

URL verdict changes are a simple and easy way for malicious
content to make its way into a company. A simple innocuous link can be
changed post-delivery to a site or file that the end user was not
expecting.

SecOps get "A potentially malicious URL click was detected"
alerts from a different system. But for ease, Microsoft has made it
simple to navigate to the alert page and explore the alerts
directly. The investigation graph breaks down the incident and includes
all the actions and objects associated with the particular incident.
After the investigation starts, it's going to analyze that particular
email where the malicious URL was identified, then start to
investigate following a series of defined steps. These steps include
looking at the emails that may be related to this, as well as the user,
and any machines that may be affected by leveraging Microsoft Defender
ATP integration.

SecOps can easily follow up directly with the user who has performed
some risky user behavior and investigate further, because perhaps this
action was not the real user at all. This integration of Microsoft 365
ATP with MCAS helps provide customers an extensive
visibility into the threat landscape. This comprehensive, integrated
protection is a differentiator for MTP.

The Logs tab provides you with a breakdown of the incident as a detailed
timeline of events: from the initial click, identification of the
URL verdict change, user investigation, all the way to the
recommended actions. Here you can truly follow the process that
AIR took while investigating the incident. Clicking into these
entities will open the AIR explorer, and from there you can get
more information on each item.

MTP with Automatic Investigation and Response allows Security
teams to quickly examine and respond to threats to protect their
organizations from harmful activities, as well as identify potential
threats and proactively respond to them to discourage risky user
behavior.

### Zero-hour auto purge investigation

Zero-hour auto purge helps to remove the infected messages from your
Microsoft 365 mailboxes.

In the email tab, all the emails are clustered by the type, as well as
similar files, such as attachments including relevant threats (malware,
phish). If you want more details, click back on the email cluster
details tab. From the explorer page, you can view similar items in email,
including Sender(s), Subject(s), as well as the Body of the messages,
all matching the fingerprint of the original alert.

![](https://o365hq.com/images/665.png)

You can also identify if there were any malicious URLs within
the zapped mail and if anyone clicked on them and see the origin of the
email in a map view.

Clicking on the user's tab, you will find the originally targeted user,
as well as a risk assessment of that user. By clicking on that user, and
then on the Evidence tab, you can analyze the relevant user activities
and risks identified across audit logs, Exchange Online Protection, and
Microsoft Cloud App Security.

Clicking on the Machine tab lets you see how Microsoft Defender
ATP integration with MTP AIR can really
secure your company and help you identify the threat on your machine.

![](https://o365hq.com/images/666.png)

You can always head back to the incident alert to see what Microsoft
Defender ATP AIR has discovered about the incident.
MTP AIR is deep-linked into Microsoft Defender
ATP investigations on machines that are Azure AD or Hybrid
Azure AD joined and enrolled in Microsoft Defender ATP
services. This takes advantage of the policies based on Microsoft
ATP alerts and investigations. This "signal/information
sharing" between Office ATP and Microsoft Defender ATP
allows this integration to happen, and to happen automatically when a
zero-hour malware is detected and zapped.

![](https://o365hq.com/images/668.png)

Clicking the entities tab on the investigation page helps you find all
the objects that were involved in the incident. You can see the
machines, users, emails, files, and email clusters all centrally located
in this section. The Action tab provides a list of recommended actions
for SecOps to contain and mitigate threats in the analysis.

Microsoft Threat Protection gives SecOps teams an opportunity to explore
incidents faster, easier, and protect your endpoints more securely.
