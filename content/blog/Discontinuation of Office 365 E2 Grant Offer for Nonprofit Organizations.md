### Can I apply for Office 365 E1 Grant? 

Microsoft previously provided Office 365 E1 as the primary cloud grant offer for eligible nonprofit organizations. The E1 grant of up to 2,000 seats has also been discontinued in CSP channel and is now only available via an Enterprise Agreement (EA) through a Licensing Solution Partner (LSP).  

Microsoft will continue to provide nonprofits with discounts of up to 75% on many other Microsoft 365 products for those nonprofit organizations that do not have an EA, but with some changes in the pricing:  

* Office 365 E1 (from US$2.00 to US$2.50) 
* Office 365 E3 (from US$4.50 to US$5.75) 
* Office 365 E5 (from US$14.00 to US$15.20) 
* Microsoft 365 E3 (from US$8.00 to US$9.00) 
* Microsoft 365 Business Premium (from US$5.00 to US$5.50) 

### What are my options? 

Microsoft now provides Microsoft 365 Business Basic and Microsoft 365 Business Premium as their primary cloud grant offers and continues to provide grants of up to 2000 licenses of Office 365 E1 via an Enterprise Agreement.  

Office 365 E1 or Microsoft 365 Business Basic, both plans are comparable to their existing subscription. Business Basic has a maximum user count of 300 and all 300 of those seats are granted at $0. Microsoft also provides a donation of 10 free licenses of Microsoft 365 Business Premium. Please, check [Feature Matrix](https://m365maps.com/matrix.htm) to compare the plans.
