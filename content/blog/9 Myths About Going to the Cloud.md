title = "9 Myths About Going to the Cloud"
description = "A couple of years ago, companies were really thinking about the cloud in a very simplistic sense, as moving their VMs (virtual machines) from their on-premises data centers into the cloud. Now we're seeing an explosion of services and capabilities in the cloud that companies can take advantage of. The cloud enables all sorts of new capabilities and functionalities in cloud apps, allowing businesses to reach new customers and predict the future with machine learning and advanced analytics, to name but a few. But some businesses are still hesitant about moving to the cloud, in light of the existing myths around migration to Office 365, which are in fact quite different from the real state of affairs. Let’s debunk them!"

### Myth 1 -- The migration to Office 365 is too complicated

**Fact -- Moving to the cloud is a gradual and flexible process**

Migration is not a piece of cake -- it is a big project that requires a
detailed approach when developing your migration strategy. But you
don't have to do it overnight. It is a process, and you choose its scale
and speed, depending on your particular needs. In fact, you won't be
alone -- at all stages, starting from assessment of your environment to
developing the migration plan and finally implementing it, you will get the
support of experts.

### Myth 2 The cloud is as troublesome as a traditional environment

**Fact -- You can invest your time in something better than hardware
maintenance and software updates**

Traditional digital estate includes hardware (you probably have a few
file servers, active directory, mail, and archive servers) that needs to
be maintained, and software that needs to be updated -- a lot of
headaches for you! Whereas, when you move to Office 365, you can run your
business in the cloud and let Microsoft take care of the IT for you,
which means no more setting up servers, databases, file shares, or
on-premises software for you and your employees. After you move to the
cloud, you will find time to embrace change.

### Myth 3 -- It is too expensive

**Fact -- Migration to Office 365 will save you money in the long run**

A lot of companies are worried about high costs of moving to the cloud.
In fact, initial investment into cloud migration can really cost quite a
sum of money, but our experts can help you with subscription management
and deployment optimization, so you will pay only for what you really
need. And in the long run, you can actually reduce your costs significantly
over your on-premises deployment, as you will get all the benefits from
converting your capital expenditure to operational expenditure.

### Myth 4 -- The cloud is subject to security and privacy concerns

**Fact -- The cloud is an impregnable fortress, where data is accessible
only to its owner and not anyone else**

The idea that your data is nicely contained in an on-premises environment that is
more protected than in the cloud doesn't hold water. Microsoft has
hundreds of world-class cybersecurity experts focused on the cloud, so
the security of your applications and of your data is actually enhanced.
Microsoft runs across hundreds of data centers geo-distributed around
the world. They are built from the ground up with security in mind --
both security in terms of disaster prevention (like fire or earthquake)
and data protection; only the right people can get into the buildings,
meaning the engineer who actually works on a physical server has no
actual access to the application layer or actual environment and vice
versa; those who work on application don't have access to the physical site
(this is called separation of duties). Thus, your data is better
protected when stored in cloud data centers than locally
on-premises.

As far as privacy is concerned, the fundamental principal Microsoft
adheres to is that data belongs to the customer, and only the customer can
control it. Office 365 is only a tool that runs the service for you and
is accountable to you. Besides built-in protection, customers enjoy
unique controls that empower them to customize information protection
(like data loss prevention, information protection, email encryption,
and more).

### Myth 5 -- Go big or go home -- either move everything to the cloud or stay on-premises

**Fact -- There are various options of cloud migration -- it's up to you
to move only some of your workloads or all of them to the cloud**

Some companies think that cloud migration is an all-or-nothing choice;
that they have to move all of their applications at one time from their
datacenters into the cloud. That's not true. You can maintain some
of your applications on-premises while putting others in the cloud, and
having that ecosystem essentially transparent to all of your users. This
is a hybrid deployment, and only Microsoft can provide proper technology
to enable that. Hybrid deployment gives you flexibility to move to the
cloud at your own pace and on your own terms, or even stay in hybrid mode
as long as you want.

### Myth 6. Email on-premises vs. email online -- six of one, half a dozen of the other

**Fact -- Exchange Online has much more storage and
helpful functionalities you will adore**

Exchange is the easiest workload to move to the cloud and it's the
workload that most organizations move first. But if you still have
doubts about it, here are a couple of arguments in favor of Exchange
Online:

1.  In Exchange Online, everything is updated automatically -- you don't
    have to spend time patching and applying cumulative updates to the
    software
2.  Storage -- Exchange Online is MUCH larger. If you add up
    the amount of data that's available to each user, you start off from
    a very basic 100 gig for your mailbox, 100 gig for your
    archive (and you can enable ever-expanding archives), 100 gig for
    recoverable items...there's 300 gigs straight away
3.  Great opportunities for data governance and compliance
    (functionalities like retention policies, classification,
    e-discovery and content searches, and data loss prevention work
    across Exchange)
4.  You don't have to have any complexity of rights management -- your
    Exchange Online tenant is automatically enabled for encryption
5.  Security is one of the most critical parts of Exchange Online --
    so you do see things like policy tips inside OWA (Outlook
    Web Access), you see messages being marked as potentially malicious.
    Messages coming from unknown senders are flagged to bring them to your attention.

### Myth 7 -- Office 365 is available only online

**Fact -- Office 365 provides options to work offline too**

If you need to work in a distant place, like the mountains, wild woods, or
high seas, Office 365 gives you the opportunity. When signed in to
your account, you can use all O365 functionalities for up to 30 days.
After this period is over, you still need to connect to the Internet to
get the latest updates and you can get back "into the wild" for another
30 days, if you want. To work with the files stored in the cloud, you
should first synchronize your PC with OneDrive before going offline.
After synchronization, your OneDrive files will be downloaded to your
hard drive and you will be able to access them from there. Once you are
back to the "online world," all the changes will automatically be uploaded to
OneDrive.

### Myth 8 -- Collaboration options in O365 are pretty much the same as in plain chat or meeting apps

**Fact -- Teams in Office 365 is your virtual collaboration workplace**

Despite Office 365 already offering collaboration tools like Yammer,
Outlook, SharePoint, and Skype -- it's almost certain that Teams is the
best solution for your teamwork. Microsoft Teams is a chat-based
workplace that gives people one place to communicate and use
creativity in innate ways. You can get static threads to
communicate, and you can go back to the archives and see them. Teams is
designed for cooperation in real time and in a completely non-friction
manner. Teams offer a possibility for people to interact in multiple
teams and ensures no need to use 15 different collaboration tools. As it
is part of the Office 365 suite of tools of cooperation, it is part of what
users are already used to, meaning you can allocate tasks right in the
conversation by simply creating or sharing and formatting many kinds of
documents, from Word to Excel to PowerPoint. It couldn't be more
comfortable than that. Customization, enhanced security, mobile calling,
email integration and more makes Teams a unique asset to
increase your company's efficiency

### Myth 9 -- Office 365 is incompatible with third-party business-critical apps

**Fact -- Microsoft is constantly working to make Office 365 compatible
with the apps your employees need for effective work**

Microsoft is always adding functionality and making improvements to
Office 365, so when your users need a new third-party tool, you don't
have to worry about its security. Instead, you can rely on a security
framework that's already in place, allowing users to take advantage of
the productivity. This means your IT department can allow users to adopt
the tool that best fits their needs. The single identity gives you the
ability to bring in third-party cloud providers and integrate with your Azure
AD user account, using the same security and compliance tools that you
do for Office 365. Long story short, your users can use
business-critical apps, easily integrating them into their Office 365
accounts, giving them access to necessary data and enjoying the
security your admins will appreciate.

Summing up our myths-debunking article, let's outline one important
point: when you start moving toward the cloud, you may be astonished to
find out how many interesting and useful features you may discover
exploring Office 365. That's a great opportunity for your business to be
more cost-efficient and control the process of your information and
communication management, and much more.
