description = "In the middle of May 2019, a compliance and security conference took place and, in case you missed it, we’ve prepared the recap of some sessions for you. One of the presentations was hosted by Silvia Kingsmill, a partner in a risk consulting practice at KPMG Canada, and a National Data Protection and Privacy Leader (yes, you’re not mistaken, the very same KPMG from the Big Four accounting firms). This session was devoted to an overview of the regulatory landscape. She spoke about data privacy, cyber security, data governance, digital transformation, and what’s more important, offered advice on how to reach compliance and improve the security posture of an organization.

According to Silvia, data is the \#1 strategically important asset; it is
the new oil of the digital economy. It enables us to give a better
customer experience, and transforms the way we work, live, play, and
interact with one another via social media channels. It gives every
organization the ability to drive insights into the customer experience
to deliver better products and services and transform industries.
However, all of this doesn't come without risk. Data needs to be
managed, used responsibly, ethically, and there need to be
accountability measures in place. So, let's discover some of the
challenges and operational pitfalls that KPMG observes with
data risk management in the post-GDPR world.

### Drivers of market disruption

KPMG defines four drivers of change responsible for
market disruption, the first of which is *massive cyber and privacy
breaches*, which have resulted in class action lawsuits, extensive fines,
penalties, and regulatory scrutiny.

*Regulatory landscape* is the second driver of change. GDPR, or
General Data Protection Regulation, for example, imposes extreme fines
and penalties for non-compliance. It requires organizations to think
differently about privacy risk management and the robustness of their
existing compliance programs.

The third driver of change is emerging technology. This includes digital
transformation influenced by artificial intelligence, big data, and the
Internet of things. Organizations are becoming more privacy aware, and
more sensitive to the impact these emerging technologies have on
customers. There is a big trend in the industry; going over and
above regulation, where industry organizations are getting together to
develop industry standards for certification purposes (like the CIO
Strategy Council, the International Organization for Standardization, and
others). It enables emerging technologies to be rolled out safely, in an
ethical and trustworthy manner.

The fourth driver of change is the need for proof of compliance. It's no
longer enough to say we're "doing" privacy, and we're "thinking about"
cybersecurity and risk management. Organizations are required to be
accountable for their information handling practices, and they need to
operationally track and demonstrate due diligence. So, there's another
trend in the marketplace for privacy certification schemes and global
certifications against ISO standards, like privacy by design,
for example. This KPMG expert expects that in 2 or 3 years, we'll
see the evolution of ISO standards for privacy by design for
consumer business services.

GDPR and its global impact

Buzz words we hear all the time are accountability,
responsibility, transparency, ethics, and trust. Organizations are in
the business of trust, and the EU's GDPR raises the bar of the
data protection standard. GDPR became the game changer in terms
of citizens' rights, as it standardized and harmonized the rules across
EU states and let citizens challenge the companies if they use their
data without consent, transparency, and accountability. And it is also a
game changer for the supply chain, as data processors and data
controllers collecting information at first instances are equally
responsible for data protection. To learn more about GDPR,

.

Governments around the world are enacting similar GDPR-like
legislation.

In the absence of legislation, regulatory guidance that mirrors the
language of the GDPR has been issued by different data
protection commissioners around the world. Silvia Kingsmill predicts
global changes that will line up to the expectations around data
protection under the GDPR.

There is also a philosophical shift and organizational commitment to
privacy, which is about proactive risk management and a movement away
from a tick-the-box compliance exercise to the exercise that looks to
remediate the highest risk when it comes to information and data
management.

### Privacy by design

Leading-edge companies and regulators are committing to privacy by
design. It is the philosophy of embedding privacy and security into the
system design and architecture of any emerging technology, into
day-to-day business practices, and into the organizational culture, making
sure that you proactively manage the risk up front and not retrofit
your systems. In fact, KPMG has developed a privacy by design
risk assessment framework that falls under a "comply once, attest to
many" (standards) approach.

### Operational challenges

Companies and organizations are left on their own while implementing
some of the new standards and regulations we are seeing in the
world of AI, privacy, cybersecurity, and risk management. By
KPMG's observations, it's most often the simple things that get
companies into trouble with privacy violations, and the reason for most
of them is a disconnection between people, processes, governance, and
technology. Some of the findings KPMG has in their
privacy risk assessment reports are around the over-collection of data,
and as a result, the over-retention of it, which increases your privacy
risk exposures and your attack surface.

Another way that companies get into trouble is the lack of transparency
in the legal language and poorly written privacy policies. According to
the regulations, it is expected that companies have accurate and
user-friendly privacy policies enabling the customer to understand
what information is collected, for what purpose, how it's going to be
protected -- and if it's ever going to be shared with third parties,
consent will be requested. Monetization of data is also prohibited if it's
not done responsibly and ethically. Leveraging insights from the data an 
organization has about its customer is completely acceptable
if it relies on consent, is done in conjunction with transparent policies
and procedures, and enables an individual to withdraw consent and to
challenge the privacy practices of an organization.

The biggest way companies get into trouble is by ignoring
regulatory expectations. Regulatory guidance is more instructive and
more important to take note of, as it is what a regulator will look for
if you are involved in a privacy investigation or breach complaint.

### Digital gets personal

As organizations are in the business of trust, the competitive
differentiator will be the capability of organizations to respect
consumer privacy and show transparency around information handling.
It's all about managing expectations, whether it be from a customer,
from a government or legislator, or from regulators.

KPMG is seeing privacy programs evolving where cybersecurity
is part of a privacy equation. Organizations are elaborating on their
privacy and security programs enterprise-wide to embed privacy into
corporate processes and technology decisions, such as in strategic
business planning, project management lifecycle, and enterprise risk
reporting.

There's greater awareness around privacy breaches and as a result,
organizations have become more sensitive to it. They are making pledges
to their customers through certification mechanisms to ensure that they
continue to earn and keep their customers' trust and manage their
expectations in line with privacy and security best practices.

KPMG has conducted several global surveys, interviewing 1,700
CEOs. The results proved that digital is getting personal. It
means that protecting customers' data is no longer just a part of
corporate social responsibility, it's about doing the right thing.
There's a mind shift that implies seeing data, privacy, security, and
risk management as opportunities for the organization to build privacy
and security figures into their day-to-day business operations and
transformation. For more numbers, see the image below.

### Some industry trends

It's a myth to say that privacy is only about the B2C environment. B2B
organizations are equally interested in privacy rules because they deal
with B2C-focused companies that want sufficient guarantees around the
privacy protections that are embedded across the supply chain.
Contracts are only as good, like paper, as they are written on, if the
vendors don't live up to the commitments they make in their privacy
policies and in the contracts between the data giver and the data taker.

![](https://o365hq.com/images/367.png)

*A shift to privacy-by-design thinking* around the release of products
and services shows that companies are more concerned with the question
of what should we be doing with our data to continue innovating and to
preserve the trust of our customers, which must be balanced with the
regulatory framework around the responsible use of data.

Data mapping has been a cybersecurity practice for many years, and now
it's required under the GDPR as law. It means that you need to
understand where your data assets live in order to protect them. More
mature organizations are trending to *automation* (instead of Excel
sheets) for *data mapping*.

Under the GDPR, a *data protection officer* role must be
designated under certain circumstances, but more and more companies are
doing so as a best practice. These employees are required to develop,
monitor, and sustain the privacy program.

### Compliance is a team effort

Data protection and privacy are the responsibility of not only a
compliance officer but also legal, business/data analytics and technology,
and infosec teams alongside the internal audit team.

Compliance is not a destination, it's a journey. On the way, you may go
through the following stages:

![](https://o365hq.com/images/365.png)

It's important to note that many organizations, irrespective of sector or
industry, are still trying to figure out their data process inventory and
identify where their most critical data assets live (what server, what
application) in order to be able to safeguard the information and
understand which third parties or others have access to the information,
and ensure there is no inappropriate data access resulting in risk
exposures.

If your company is also concerned with the inventory and
classification of data assets and you want to follow the trend of
automating these processes, you can count on [IT Partner's GDPR
data discovery
Service](https://o365hq.com/services/gdpr-data-discovery-service) .

All the different components of the compliance journey can be used
together as a good due diligence defense should a regulator come
knocking on your door in the event of a privacy complaint or privacy 
cyber breach investigation. In fact, it can also be used to lessen the
severity of fine or a penalty.

### Conclusion

A holistic risk management program, when it comes to privacy and
security, has several building blocks to it. It starts with a sound
business strategy that incorporates data protection, privacy, and
cybersecurity. It also involves privacy-by-design thinking and proactive
risk management practices that include privacy policies and procedures,
and a sustainable target operating model (TOM). Don't forget
about training and awareness, because people are often the weakest link.
A good program requires good metrics, risk reporting, and evaluation of
the entire program end to end, as well as stress testing and incident
response policies and procedures.

Measuring your risk posture presumes to understand which practices are
effective and which are useless. To find your effective practices,
KPMG advises to set the position of a fully dedicated
chief privacy officer (CPO) or data protection officer
(DPO) that has the full backing of the Board and TOM
from the top.

Keeping up with privacy-by-design thinking requires training of personnel
and stress testing of policies and procedures. Don't neglect stress
testing, it is critical, as monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness
of the entire program is one of the success factors.

Trustworthy companies are required to have a well-written and fully
documented defensible position in the event of a regulatory challenge.
Nothing is foolproof, as hackers are always ten steps ahead.
Turning compliance into a competitive advantage and market
differentiator means being proactive about your risks and embedding privacy
and security up front.
