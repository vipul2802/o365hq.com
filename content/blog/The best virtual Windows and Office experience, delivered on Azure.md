### How does the WVD solution reduce costs?

WVD reduces customer costs by reducing infrastructure,
licensing, and labor costs. Multisession Windows 10 allows significant
savings in computer resources, and WVD service now replaces
complex management requirements of RDS/VDI solutions.
WVD is free to use with\
many existing licenses, and you no longer have to pay for RDS
CAL licenses. Finally, labor savings are realized by the shift
from IaaS to PaaS, removing the need to manage core services like
broker/gateway/web access, etc., reducing management overhead.

environment to your users. New Container technology enables fast load
times and provides a performance experience for Outlook, OneDrive,
