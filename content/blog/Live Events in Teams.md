There are four key roles involved in running a Teams Live Event
properly:

-   Organizer
-   Producer
-   Presenter(s)
-   Attendees

After you have created an event, you automatically become its organizer
and a producer. This enables you to configure attendee permissions,
decide on the production method, and set up event options. It is also
possible to invite attendees, select event group members, and manage
reports generated after the event is over. The organizer is also
responsible for the event setup and any testing required before the
event. As the producer you can start and stop the event, share yours and
participant\`s video, active desktop and control the live event stream
to ensure attendees have a great viewing experience.

To be able to create a live event, you need to have:

-   An Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3 or E5 license or an Office 365 A3 or
    A5 license.
-   Permission to create live events in Microsoft Stream or Microsoft
    Teams admin center.
-   Full team membership in the organization.
-   Private meeting scheduling, screensharing, and IP video sharing,
    turned on in Team meeting policy.

It is possible to have multiple presenters on your live events. The
presenters share many of the basic capabilities as the producer, but
they have less control of the video feeds and the live even itself.\
Your Teams Live Event external or internal attendees can join the event
via their invitation link and can either view the event in their web
browser or Teams app if they have it. Live events can broadcast to
specific people, across the entire organization, or publicly. Teams
provides finite audience control to ensure correct people are in
attendance (or not in attendance).

You can easily produce the live event in Teams or use an external app or
device. A third-party external encoder is used to capture audio and
video from the various sources such as cameras, microphones, and desktop
screen capture. Encoders are mostly used for professional studio events
with high-end cameras and high-fidelity equipment.

If you schedule a live event in Teams, it will be automatically added to
your event group\`s calendar. In the Teams, select *Calendar* from the
panel and choose *New meeting \> Live event.* Once you have added the
meeting title, date and time information, you can use the *Invite people
to your event group box* to add the people who will be presenting and
producing the event.

There exist several live events permission types that help you decide on
who can attend your live event:

1.  If you select *People and groups*, the event will only be viewed by
    people or groups you name (max. 150 email addresses).
2.  *Org-wide* permission type allows everyone in your company watch the
    live event, including external participants.
3.  If you set up *Public* permission it means anyone can easily attend
    your live event inside and outside of your organization.

Additional event options when using the in-Teams production include
Recording available to attendees, Attendee engagement report and Q&A,
which allows attendees to collaborate with producers and presenters,
giving participants opportunities to speak up and bring remote attendees
into the meeting experience. By posting to a Teams conversation, you can
personalize the message with advanced text formatting and details.

Microsoft Teams live events allow you to schedule and produce events
that stream to large online audiences and take place in real-time from
anywhere, on any device. As a producer, you manage the live event stream
from start to end. You can open and share content, show Q&A, and post
and announcement welcoming everyone to the meeting, further
personalizing the experience. Teams makes it easy to connect the
audience to the event from anywhere the event link is posted.
