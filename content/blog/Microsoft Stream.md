Stream is not only storage for videos --- it enables a more social,
connected organization by connecting with employees and conveying
meaningful messages. Its more thorough search capabilities help discover
the moments in the video that matter most. Integrating with Office 365,
Microsoft Stream gives you an opportunity to bring videos to the apps
you use the most.

### It's easy to participate!

A personalized Stream home page makes the user experience very intuitive,
with everything one needs in easy view. From the top navigation, you can
discover content, either across all of Stream or just the content you
created or want to follow.

The *Create* menu is used to quickly upload a video or create a channel or
group. These top-level menus are always visible, making them easy to
access from anywhere in Stream. The *Discover* menu helps filter videos,
channels, people, or groups.

In Stream, groups and channels are used to arrange and give permissions
to videos.

Groups help manage videos, monitor access, and define owners and members.
They are based on *Office 365 Groups*. So, if a group exists in Stream,
a new *Office 365 Group* is also created, giving it an email address,
calendar, etc. Each group also has its own mini video portal, with
current and new content in the group.

*Channels* allow arranging videos about a certain subject either inside
a Group or as a standalone, company-wide channel. They are a
systematization method, but not a permissions method. However, if a
channel is created inside a Group, that channel will take up the Group's
permissions. The viewers can receive updates regarding new videos and
attach them to the channel if they already follow it.

*Trending Videos* and *Popular Channels* keep track of what others in
the organization are watching or following.

### Upload and share videos

With Microsoft Stream, it is simple to attach videos, create channels,
and share content.

If you need to publish and share a video, just select it, add a
description to it, and identify who will be allowed to see or modify it.\
*The Details section* allows specifying a name, details, and a language
to enable automatic closed captioning.

In the *Permissions section*, you may select specific Office 365 groups,
channels, or even specific people in the company. The *Options section*
is for changing settings like face detection, commenting, captioning,
etc.

The *Share options* help share the video directly in several ways: copy
and paste a link into an email and specify a time point at which to
start playback, or get the embed code and set options for rendering the
video (for example, on a web page).

Publishing a new video and its metadata may take time to complete. It is
highly recommended to publish videos with a size of 2-4 MB or less.

### Intelligence for easy access and search

Stream's intelligence features offer more ways to find and interact with
videos. Using automated speech-to-text transcription and face detection
makes searching for videos powerful and fast. Automatic transcription
enables all words in the transcript to become searchable metadata.
Results and videos will contain the search term in the title or comments,
as well as in the transcript. Searching the transcript is very helpful
for finding content within longer videos, such as training or executive
presentations. Automatic face detection helps visualize where each
person appears in the video. Stream's intelligence also drives
accessibility, so every person can engage according to individual needs.
Stream also provides a secure social experience that allows engaging
with videos in familiar ways, such as sharing via email, liking, and
adding comments.

### Collaborate in familiar apps and devices

Stream is all about collaboration. Intuitive video sharing through
familiar browsers and apps makes it easier for everyone to engage and
collaborate productively, wherever they are. Team members can easily
download, view, and share videos right inside Office 365 apps like
Microsoft Teams, Sway, SharePoint, and Yammer -- all using single
sign-on. It is possible to play videos right in *Yammer* and use *Teams*
as a collaboration hub for all activities and projects. Playback in the
Teams app also brings over the rich experience from Stream. Users can
even search within the video right in the Teams app.

Stream is available across devices and provides the best quality
available using adaptive bitrate streaming (ABR), which gives
you a good viewing experience whether you are on WiFi, LTE, or
even 3G.

The mobile experience offers the same features as on the desktop, such
as a searchable transcript, comments, links to other videos in Stream,
and face detection.

### Every video is secure

Secure access to Stream is powered by Azure Active Directory, a
well-known leader in identity management solutions, to keep sensitive
corporate content safe. In addition to such security settings as
sharing for uploaded videos, you can also restrict comments and define
who can upload and create channels or administer Stream groups. With
enabled enterprise-wide content policies, employees are required to
optionally accept terms before they upload.

Stream simplifies video storage and security, offers an easy-to-use and
intuitive user experience, and reduces burdens on admins. As a result,
it is more simple and easy for companies and their employees to connect and
collaborate with video than ever before.
