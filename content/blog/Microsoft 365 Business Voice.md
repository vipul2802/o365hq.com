The **Contacts** section is where all your internal and external
contacts are. It is also possible to see your call history. You can
easily answer incoming calls on any of your devices, including directly
from within the Teams desktop app. With Business Voice, you get
intelligent **Caller ID** from phone numbers outside of your company. If
you need to consult with one of your colleagues, just click more actions
and then click the **Consult then transfer** function. This puts your
customer in a **Call park** while you consult with your colleague.

It is easy to use the Teams mobile app with voice from any device and
while on the go. By simply tapping a contact, you are instantly connected
with your customer. Back at your desk, you can use the Teams desktop
app. A team can exist within an organization, a project, or even an
interest group. In Teams, you and your co-workers cooperate through
channel and 1:1 conversations, set up meetings, and share files.
Meetings can include multiple people from both inside and outside your
organization.

Another way you can easily stay on top of your day is through Outlook.
Joining an ad hoc call and scheduling meetings is made easy right
through Outlook, saving you time and giving attendees the flexibility
they need with a conferencing dial-in number in every meeting.\
From within Outlook, you can check all your customer contacts, LinkedIn,
and membership info. Microsoft 365 Voice is built for productivity, and
IT Administrators use it to keep safe with built-in protection, privacy,
and compliance from a trusted cloud.

Microsoft 365 Business Voice makes getting started in minutes easy,
without any hardware to install or manage. The IT administrator will see
a new first-run experience when logging into the Microsoft 365 admin
center. To start this process, the IT Administrator simply clicks **Get
started**.

In order to get a phone number, an address for emergency services must
be assigned. Microsoft services will even double-check to ensure the
administrator enters a valid and legal address.

Here, the IT administrator can assign phone numbers to his or her coworkers who
need one. Now, all the users at your company who need a phone number
currently have one assigned.

The next thing the administrator does is create an optional greeting for
incoming calls. A greeting can be typed in or the administrator can
optionally upload an existing audio file to use instead. The
administrator can use call forwarding so all calls are directed to the
correct person or department and no calls slip through the cracks. First
the administrator selects a dial key, then types in instructions for the
person calling. Next, he or she selects the correct person or alias to forward
the call to. The **Calling instructions** section is also customizable;
if the administrator has a custom greeting, they can upload the audio
file here. If the administrator doesn't have a greeting, they can type
out a custom greeting and callers will hear computer-generated menu
options based on what the administrator writes.

Microsoft 365 Business Voice allows you to save the company money by
using one provider for all your business communications with a low
monthly price. From the Microsoft 365 admin home page, the administrator
can control all Microsoft 365 services, including voice.

By simply clicking into a user, the administrator has several management
options, such as adding or removing licenses and apps. 
Click-management of available apps and licenses in one place saves
administrators time.

Microsoft 365 Business simplifies IT processes by managing voice from
the same admin console as the rest of O365 services. For more granular
control of services such as Exchange, SharePoint, and Teams, the
administrator can navigate to their individual admin centers.

Microsoft 365 Business Voice keeps your business running smoothly with a
cloud-based phone system. Every employee can have a direct phone number
and add it as a second line to their personal phone for business use.
All the administrator has to do is assign that user a new number.
Administrators can also distribute service numbers, which can be assigned
to a conference bridge or Resource account. By issuing employees a
company number, the administrator negates the need for employees to give
out personal phone numbers to customers, so work and personal life can
stay separate.

Emergency services will come to the **emergency location** when phoned.
Administrators can have more than one emergency location for their
organization, but there must be at least one configured for Microsoft
365 Business Voice.

The administrator can configure intelligent call routing and management
to handle the company's calls and voicemails. The
administrator can easily manage features like private calling, call
forwarding, routing to call groups, and inbound call routing to
voicemail.

Setting up auto-attendant is easy. Administrators can choose from an
operator, a person in their organization, or a voice app. The
administrator can update the company's greeting message with an audio file
or type in a greeting message and configure different menu
options and the greeting message for menu choices when a caller is
redirected to a different department within an organization.

Your business hours are configurable too, as are holiday hours and
how the auto-attendant's flow will execute. The administrator has the
option to have a greeting message, route the call to a voicemail box, or
disconnect the call. Here, the administrator can update and view the
company's holiday call settings. Holiday call settings can be customized
for employees based on region, company culture, or any other reason. The
administrator can include all users with phone numbers to be available
in the company directory or choose a custom user group. The
administrator can also upload a custom greeting, play music on hold, or
add call agents. **Call overflow handling** and **Call time** out is
also customizable.

Microsoft 365 Business Voice is easily managed in a central location,
saving you money and streamlining your IT processes with the ability to
customize features such as call queues, call attendants, and intelligent
call routing & management.
