This makes users more susceptible to malware attacks and turns Window 7
to a minefield of security threats. New apps are created for the latest
version of OSes. It is very crucial for such industries like healthcare
and e-commerce as they operate with lots of customer confidential
information and, sometimes, old software version means extremely poor
performance.

Microsoft stopped mainstream support for Windows 7 in January 2015, with
extended support running till 14 January 2020. After that, Microsoft
will no longer provide any assistance for PCs with Windows 7. You can
still run Windows 7, but your computers will be open to various
cyber attacks and security hazards when support stops. It is possible to
stay safe on Windows 7 and acquire Extended Security Updates
(ESU). It\`s a good solution to keep your hardware safe and
invulnerable for some time.

The Extended Security Update (ESU) program is an alternative
for consumers to manage certain legacy Microsoft products after the
support is ended. Simply put: Microsoft will continue creating security
updates, but you are only able to get them if you pay up. It covers 
essential upgrades for three years after the product\`s End of Extended
Support date, but it doesn't involve new features and customer-requested
non-security upgrades.

Microsoft realizes that business, governments and other companies are at
a different stage in the updating process. \*On December 1, 2019, all
organizations with Windows 7 will have an opportunity to buy
ESU through the CSP program on a per-device basis and
it will get more expensive every year. \*
