Teams already has a free version, but it places limits on certain
features. Free Teams users can record meetings, for instance, but they
only get 2 GB of file storage, as opposed to the full terabyte enjoyed
by paying customers. What Microsoft is quietly offering is a trial that
includes all of those features.

Microsoft has said it plans to update the free app, beginning on March
10, to lift its restrictions on user limits and allow users to schedule
meetings for video calling and conferencing.

At Microsoft, top concern is the wellbeing of our employees and
supporting our customers in dealing with business impact during this
challenging time. For many individuals and organizations, Microsoft
Teams video-conferencing, chat, and collaboration are playing an
important role in helping people continue to work and collaborate. By
making Teams available to all for free for six months, we hope that we
can support public health and safety by making remote work even easier.
