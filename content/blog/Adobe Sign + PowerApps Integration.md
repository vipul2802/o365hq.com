These apps speed and simplify business and keep you connected to the customer. With
such apps, you are always aware of the problems your customers face
while managing their business processes. The *Service Customer Management*
app provides only the data needed to support customers efficiently.

Adobe Sign is an e-signature service used on all documents where a legal,
trusted signature is required. It provides the tools to complete digital
processes. Migrating to an all-digital process with Adobe Sign ensures
the transition from paper is secure, meets compliance needs, and
provides the needed control over the company's signed documents.

Adobe Sign features a no-code Flow connector with 25+ templates to get
you started, and the power to access the Adobe Sign REST
API calls allows you to access the broad set of features available.

Once you complete your work, the app instantly creates a new Work
Verification document for signing. The app can open the browser either
on a PC or on a mobile device, and allows the customer to sign as easily
as with paper. The customer does not need to open an email or create an
account as part of this sign-off. And if there are changes needed, the
file can still be updated until it is signed. Using Adobe Sign to
complete your app transformation allows your company to finish business
faster. This is just an example of the hundreds of business processes
that you can automate with 200-plus connector sources that will work
with Microsoft Flow, PowerApps, and Adobe Sign.

### Adding Adobe Sign to PowerApps

This app uses two Flows to connect PowerApps, SharePoint, and Adobe
Sign. The Adobe connector provides easy-to-fill-out fields that support
single and multiple participant signing. It pulls data from SharePoint,
playing the part of Dynamics 365, or Salesforce, or any of the dozens of
companies that, like Adobe, have provided connectors to Microsoft Flow.

The document that is ready to sign can be sent to the customer using an
email, or set up to sign in person, or both, if the business process
supports the customer choosing that option.

It is easy to call the Adobe Sign REST API directly
from Flow when the no-code connectors do not yet cover a requirement.
Flow uses the returned Agreement ID for the document that needs
signing and requests the signing URL for that document and that
participant. That URL is returned to the app in a few seconds,
where it opens the document for signing. It takes only one line of code
for PowerApps to leverage the power of the Flow. One Flow and in a few
seconds, any app can leave paper signatures behind.

*Adobe provides powerful triggers for Flow.* This trigger occurs
whenever an agreement completes the signing workflow in the Adobe Sign
account. This trigger can be refined to trigger an account, group, or
even a single agreement. It then requests a PDF copy of that
signed document with the complete Audit Report attached.

The document can be filed in a specific location in SharePoint where
access is managed by the SharePoint owners and admins. So, the business
users never need to log in to Adobe Sign to provide proof of signature.

Adobe Sign helps you finish business faster. But more importantly, it
provides secure, documented records for business interactions requiring
a signature.

The tools Adobe has provided developers to manage and interact with the
service enable them to add this capability to any app or custom
development project.
