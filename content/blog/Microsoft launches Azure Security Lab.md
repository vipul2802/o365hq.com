The Azure Security Lab is a set of dedicated cloud hosts for security
researchers to test attacks against IaaS scenarios, and which is
isolated from Azure customers. As well as offering a secure testing
space, the lab program will enable participating researchers to engage
directly with Microsoft Azure security experts. Accepted applicants will
have access to quarterly campaigns for targeted scenarios with added
incentives, as well as regular recognition and exclusive swag.

Microsoft is committed to ensuring our cloud is secure from modern
threats. They built Azure with security in mind from the beginning, and
work to help customers secure their Azure cloud environment with
products such as Azure Sentinel and Azure Security Center. And if a
situation arises, Microsoft's Cloud Defense Operations Center
(CDOC) and security teams work around the clock to identify,
analyze, and respond to threats in real time.
