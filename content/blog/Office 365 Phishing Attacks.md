### Microsoft 365 phishing attacks are on the rise

Microsoft 365 has gained in popularity among hackers for the past few years.
M365 is a multisystem workspace with lots of sensitive information.
Administrators can manage credentials across various Microsoft 365
services, such as OneDrive, Skype, SharePoint, and Office Store,
turning Microsoft 365 into a treasure trove for attackers. Phishing is no
longer just an email problem. A lot of employees keep their company's
confidential information in SharePoint, which can cause great harm in
case of its exposure.

### Why we keep taking the bait

With M365 credentials, a hijacker can easily manage phishing campaigns
from within the company. Attackers simply collect more sensitive data
and extend it across other companies, as well as gain account access to
get a payoff. Employees can configure filters, back-end rules, and
policies to combat the inevitable exposure email provides, but overall,
they have little control over what comes into their inbox, and phishing
campaigns are getting trickier all the time. Hackers imitate the look of
M365 messages and interfaces to mislead your staff members and trick
them into their login and password disclosure. Sometimes, phishers use
Microsoft Azure Binary Large Object (BLOB) storage to create
landing pages with Microsoft-signed SSL certificates and a
windows.net domain and perform attacks right from Microsoft 365. The
malicious emails come from legitimate accounts and this can go
unrecognized, simply because attackers are collecting data while logged
in using authorized credentials.

### Current Microsoft 365 attack types

M365 scams are getting much more sophisticated, with a unique sender/IP,
URL, and subject line for each message. These campaigns pretend
to be from Microsoft 365 and start with an email indicating that you have
missed a call and have received a voicemail. The message has a link or
an attached HTML file that redirects the user to a phishing
site created to steal your M365 login credentials. To keep yourself
protected in such phishing attacks, you should always examine thoroughly
the URLs of any landing pages with Microsoft login forms.
Another good idea is to use multi-factor authentication, as well as
different passwords for various services. It is very important to be
more cautious than ever when opening attachments from unknown senders.

Hacking is becoming increasingly profitable and scammers' software is
getting more complex. Smart campaigns anticipate the spoof messages
users may normally receive. The messages with a subject line "Actions
required" contain a link mainly hosted on a legitimate although hacked
website to trick reputation-based email filtering systems. This is the
way hijackers harvest your sensitive information and use the compromised
Microsoft 365 account to perform cyberattacks within your company.

Another popular type of attack concerns the file-sharing part of M365. You
can receive a fake email with SharePoint documents or an email with some
file-sharing notification that will redirect you to an imitated OneDrive
login page. Malicious links allow phishing attackers to bypass the
built-in security of the platform and harvest your account credentials.

### How to prevent Microsoft 365 phishing attacks

Microsoft 365 provides a broad range of benefits for business email, but it
becomes more challenging to identify Microsoft 365 phishing scams, as they
have significantly increased in sophistication and can easily bypass
most security countermeasures. Phishing campaigns are a persistent
danger to all businesses, and there are a few ways to risk mitigation when
it concerns M365 phishing scams.

One of these approaches is user awareness training. According to the
research, 52% of users receive training no more than twice a year, and
6% of users have never received security awareness training. Most
employees aren't trained to detect phishing attempts, and as a result,
they become an easy target for hackers by clicking on the links or
opening attachments in emails without considering possible serious
consequences. The more aware your employees are, the more likely they
will be able to recognize a phishing attempt.

Another way to lower the chances of your organization falling victim to
phishing scams is to add an additional security layer through an
API to complement Microsoft's Exchange Online Protection
(EOP). Using multiple anti-malware engines, it performs an
advanced, complex, real-time analysis to defend your company from unknown
cybersecurity threats. Embedded AI technologies identify new attack
methods by analyzing uncommon behaviors in the way emails are framed and
sent.

To protect sensitive information in your organization, you should be
aware of the strategies that cybercriminals use to target your business.
Make sure your employees are well-informed about various possible
phishing attacks and know how to detect danger and protect their
confidential data. A cyberattack is just a matter of time, and being able
to identify a threat early on and take actions on it can significantly
mitigate its impact.

365 and help with implementation of anti-phishing options. With IT
