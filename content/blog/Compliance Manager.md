Compliance Manager provides you with the opportunity to control your
compliance from one place, with real-time risk assessments and
streamlined compliance processes.

The Compliance Manager dashboard demonstrates a view of a company's
current data protection and compliance situation. It is possible to
observe the overall compliance performance from this one dashboard. Here
you can see that some controls are implemented by Microsoft while others
are managed by your organization. Each tile indicates a combination of a
Microsoft cloud service and the regulation against which a company wants
to measure its compliance.

When you enter the assessment framework, you can see all the services
included in the scope under the first section "Office 365 in-scope cloud
services."

The "Microsoft Managed Controls" section provides you with data about
the controls run by Microsoft, and not only shows you the control
details, but also the recommended actions a company can take to
implement the control. It also features the control management tool for
customer-managed controls.

The Compliance Manager dashboard and the contents of Microsoft-managed
controls can be made available to any user in your tenant. Tenant admins
will get a chance to manage who in the company can access the data you
download and store in the customer-managed controls section. Those who
receive access to controls will see and act on necessary action items
under their personalized *Action Items* tab.

It is also possible to upload an evidence file here, such as a report,
screen shot, or log file, and it will be automatically added to secure
and compliant cloud storage that only people in your organization can
access. Once the control has been implemented, it is marked as
"implemented."

The last feature provided by Compliance Manager is the audit-ready
reporting. You can click on  "Export to Excel" to generate reports
with all the control details and links to the evidence you collected.

Compliance Manager only offers recommendations, and they are not a
guarantee of compliance. It helps to perform real-time risk assessment,
provides actionable insights, and simplifies your compliance process.
