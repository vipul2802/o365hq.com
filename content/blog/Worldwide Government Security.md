description = "Government agencies work hard to deliver value to society. As modern technology shifts societal behavior, citizens expect their governments to adapt accordingly. The reality today is that confidence and trust in governments throughout much of the world are consistently low and constantly being challenged. Public officials have additional pressure now to double down on their good stewardship of sensitive information, but they are also required to do more with a smaller budget, which can be a hurdle to delivering on these commitments.

At the same time, governments face a growing number of threats from
increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks that often outpace IT
resources. And while external actors account for most of the breaches,
malicious intent or accidental error by insiders also account for the
loss or exposure of sensitive information. Additionally, the number of
regulations, policies, and procedures that must be met is growing year
after year. But reactive spending on security because of tight budgets
leaves agencies with trailing technology and systems that are older and
more vulnerable.

Successful governments around the world are embracing digital
transformation to spur innovation, enhance services, improve their
critical infrastructure, better engage with citizens, deliver trust in
elections, and create smart cities. All of this requires communication
across departments, agencies, and jurisdictions to deliver on those
missions. There is increased reliance on cloud and mobile, AI, and IoT
technology to meet rising citizen expectations with simple and efficient
solutions. With that, the amount of data being collected, used, and
shared is growing exponentially. As this information flows more freely
across these channels, exposure increases and there may be unintended
consequences. As this exposure increases, executives across government
organizations should work together to ensure the safety and integrity of
their organizations' data.

Microsoft 365 solutions address the needs of a modern government by
empowering employees to collaborate securely and productively. Microsoft
offers end-to-end, intelligent security solutions to help agencies
ensure that the right people have access to the right information, to
help protect against cyberattacks and to reduce compliance risk.

Citizens expect their government to do more and move faster while being
more transparent about how they are protecting public data. Delivering
on that requires continued communication and collaboration across
government entities, as well as increased reliance on cloud and mobile
technology.

But as the digital landscape grows, government agencies face increasing
risk from external cyberattackers, accidental or malicious leaks from
internal users, and a growing number of regulatory compliance
requirements to meet.

Delivering better services and increasing citizen confidence means that
your employees will need to be more reliant on technology to be
productive from anywhere on any device. To keep missions moving forward,
employees today need to be able to access government resources and
applications from many locations and devices -- including personally
owned devices. Providing extra verification (also referred to as
MFA, or multi-factor authentication) is easy and painless, but also protects the company. If
your password is compromised, a would-be attacker will still need your
phone in order to access the files.

Many government documents require different levels of security
classification. Ensuring that the right people have the right access to
the right information requires controls so they are granted access
only to resources that are necessary for their role or security
clearance. *Conditional access* policies enable your IT team to assess
risk in nearly real-time and allow dynamic access to resources as roles and
responsibilities -- or conditions -- change. This proactive control can
help you ensure users do not have blanket access to agency resources.

![](https://o365hq.com/images/738.png)

You can also download the *Outlook* mobile app and configure your work
email account using MFA on your phone to verify your identity.
If your organization uses *Microsoft Intune* to manage mobile
devices and mobile apps, you can install a government application on
your personal phone, enabling you to be efficient while away from the
office. You have permission to read the confidential document but can't
save it to your phone. Your agency can help protect access to sensitive
data on personal devices by restricting actions users can take, such as
copy-paste, save, and view.

Implementing policies and programs rarely happens in isolation.
Employees need to exchange information to collaborate and innovate on
mission objectives. However, as data is shared, vulnerabilities
increase. Microsoft 365 helps you securely share information while
reducing the risk of accidental or intentional leaks.

The release contains information about the incident that is still not
ready for the general public. You can easily attach the document, then
encrypt the entire email with a single click. This encryption ensures that
the email is only readable from the inbox of the direct recipients and
that the attachment is also encrypted. If this document is downloaded
and copied to a USB drive or to an untrusted device, the
document will remain protected. The encryption will also prevent the
recipients from forwarding the email. This applies to both internal and
external recipients. This built-in encryption helps government agencies
remain compliant by preventing intentional or accidental sharing of
emails and information. Encrypted messages can be set to expire or
revoked as needed. And these encryption actions are logged and auditable
to help meet compliance obligations.

The agency can configure policies to automatically classify, label, and
protect data based on its sensitivity. In this case, along with the
classification label, the document is also automatically protected with
rights-based permissions. So even if someone has accidentally sent this
to the press, the receiver would not be able to view the content, saving
the agency from becoming an accidental headline.

Data protection can also be managed if documents like this are uploaded
to a third-party app using Microsoft Cloud App Security, our Cloud
Access Security Broker offering.

Microsoft 365 information protection solutions help ensure that
important information is only accessible by those who are authorized to
receive and view the information and that critical data is not
accidentally released or deleted. Policies can be customized and
leveraged to automatically secure data according to compliance laws.
Policies can be applied across Microsoft Office 365, Teams, Exchange
Online, and SharePoint.

### Protecting users from cyber-threats

*Microsoft Threat Protection* is built to protect the modern institution
from sophisticated cyber-threats by offering comprehensive, advanced,
and integrated security across multiple attack vectors. Fake, phishing
emails are difficult for most users to recognize when the links and
attachments are constructed to look legitimate. In addition to solid
user education, services to stop these attempts before the user can
interact with the malicious content are important steps in preventing
these attacks from being successful.

![](https://o365hq.com/images/744.png)

*ATP Safe Links* opens and detonates the link in a secured
session to check for malicious content. It finds malicious content in
the link and gives you a warning notification that the link was in fact
malicious. This helps prevent malicious content, such as ransomware, from
being downloaded on your computer, thus proactively preventing a data
breach or credential harvest and helping to save the agency from a
potentially damaging and expensive breach.

Advanced automation powered by artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance
incident identification and response enables security teams to resolve
threats accurately, efficiently, and promptly. Machine learning also
enables us to link together individual signals, then correlate related
events to provide important context.

![](https://o365hq.com/images/746.png)

Should an attack happen, Microsoft Threat Protection automatically acts
to keep the users and the entire organization safe. The emails
containing the malicious links are soft-deleted. This means the links
have been removed and depending on the amount of malicious content in
the message, the message will be removed and placed in quarantine.

Any users who managed to click the link before neutralization will have been
recorded. This allows the admins to target education for these users.\
Automated incident response can help mitigate more threats in real time,
improving the efficiency and overall security for the organization. It
contributes to lower costs for managing information security.

As the digital landscape changes, government organizations have an
opportunity to enhance services, modernize the workplace, and improve
engagement with citizens, all while remaining trusted stewards of
sensitive data. To address the growing number of sophisticated threats
and compliance requirements, Microsoft 365 offers a breadth of tools and
services that allow governments to keep their data secure, compliant,
and accessible.
