It is possible to create your own app for processing returns using the
Microsoft Power Platform while leveraging PowerApps, Power Automate,
and Power BI. To improve efficiencies in inspecting and processing
returns, you can use a low code, mobile-friendly app built with Microsoft
PowerApps to keep pace with customer demands.

On the audit screen, you simply need to upload a picture of the returned
product to begin processing the return. With AI Builder, it is easy to
leverage AI machine learning by taking this picture and letting the app
determine what the product is. AI machine learning also gives you the
price. This is a huge time-saver! Additionally, you can also provide and
take notes or feedback on the condition of the returned product. You can
now use the time saved for even more returns and build relationships
with customers through meaningful conversations.

From the *Managers -- Returns Approvals* team, managers can review the
details of each return and approve or reject the return. Managers have a
running track of all the processed returns and can track approvals.

With thousands of processed returns each month, managers can now
leverage the newly generated data to gain valuable insights. Power BI
integration in Teams offers data-driven insights available to everyone,
enabling managers to collaborate and drive informed business decisions
faster.

Power Automate integrated within Teams enables team members to create
flows that automate repetitive work tasks, such as adding a new member
to a team. You are automatically alerted with onboarding resources, and
your team is automatically notified of a new team member -- all within
Teams!

This process is streamlined and automated once a group member is added
to a specific group and a user profile is created within Microsoft 365. A
prepopulated message is then posted within the team's conversations,
alerting everyone on the team.
