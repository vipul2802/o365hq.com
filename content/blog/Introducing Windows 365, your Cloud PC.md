### Why choose Windows 365?

Windows 365 helps employers solve challenges they’ve faced since long before the pandemic. There are three most important features you should know about Windows 365:
* Power: Windows 365 provides the full PC experience in the cloud, enabling IT to scale up or down, based on their needs. It enables users to stream all their apps, tools, data and settings from the cloud across any device.
* Simplicity: Windows 365 offers a simple and familiar Windows experience and simplifies deployment, updates and management — and unlike other solutions, Windows 365 doesn’t require any virtualization experience. With Windows 365 optimized for the endpoint, it is simple to procure and manage Cloud PCs just as you manage physical PCs through Microsoft Endpoint Manager. 
* Security: Windows 365 simplifies security by leveraging the power of the cloud and the principles of Zero Trust. Information is secured and stored in the cloud, not on the device. 

### How do I get started with Windows 365?

Windows 365 is available in two editions: Windows 365 Business and Windows 365 Enterprise. Customers with Business subscription have a limit of 300 users and can manage everything online via windows365.microsoft.com. Enterprise-level subscriptions remove this limit, allowing you to take advantage of Microsoft's Endpoint Manager data security software.
Small and midsize businesses can purchase Windows 365 directly or through a cloud service provider and set up their organization with Cloud PCs with just a few clicks.  In order to use Windows 365 Enterprise, users will need to meet the following requirements:
* With Windows Pro endpoints: Windows 10 E3 + EMS E3 or Microsoft 365 F3/E3/E5/BP.
* With non-Windows Pro endpoints: Windows VDA E3 + EMS E3 or Microsoft 365 F3/E3/F5/BP.
* Azure subscription.
