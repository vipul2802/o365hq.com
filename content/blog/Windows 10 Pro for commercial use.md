It is easy to work across multiple devices, interoperate smoothly with
Microsoft 365, and stay connected to maximize productivity. All users
benefit from a familiar Windows experience that allows them to
seamlessly run their existing apps and the full version of Microsoft
Office. Windows 10 Pro devices are speedy, affordable, and work with a
wide range of peripherals.

### Windows Autopilot

Usually, IT pros spend a significant amount of time creating and setting
up images that will be deployed to devices with the right OS already
installed on them. Windows Autopilot offers advanced technologies and
simple solutions to help you customize new devices and prepare them for
efficient use. Users only sign in and verify credentials. If you are
connecting to a public Wi-Fi hotspot, you might want to get access to a
captive portal, a web page that requires accepting terms or signing into
an ISP's service. It is fully supported by Windows Autopilot.
The Intune Enrollment Status Page shows application and profile statuses
to users during device setup and optionally lets you force all your
policies to apply before a user can start using the device, to guarantee
a consistent user experience. Microsoft offers a few different ways to
add devices: CSP partners, distributors, and resellers. If you
are purchasing from a reseller, you can easily ship devices directly to
your users without IT touching them. They would be associated with your
company out of the box.

There exist configurable options that help you manage the user's device
configuration on any device they log in to. The Settings App and Control
Panel provide you with a wide range of settings to set up your
experience. It is easy to prevent employees from changing settings by
restricting access to the Settings App and Control Panel. Intune
supports assigning user and device policies to either users or devices.
Assigned Access policies are device-level and are targeted at specific
device groups inside Azure Active Directory. Devices added manually or
dynamically to these groups will have their policies assigned
automatically. Assigned Access Shared Device policies are set at the
device level to a specific device or set of devices. When a specified
user uses that device, they will get a customized shared device
configuration based on these policies. The Multi- App shared kiosk
device can be used to configure a completely locked-down device,
offering employees multiple apps that allow them to perform their
role-specific duties, but nothing else.

Single App Shared Device mode is used more often for public-facing
kiosks where you want only one application to run automatically when the
machine boots. Single App kiosks either run a dedicated application or
run a browser with a specific web application providing the kiosk
experience. Microsoft has two options to provide a kiosk browser
experience, including the Edge Browser in Kiosk mode or the Kiosk Browser
UWP App.

### Managed desktop experience for enhanced productivity and security

Intune allows administrators to easily assign and push apps to users and
devices. It stays in sync with the added apps, and you can then manage
automated application deployment. Microsoft allows you to deploy Office
365 ProPlus apps to Windows 10 devices with Microsoft Intune. This helps
employees turn their devices into productivity powerhouses, while Azure
AD and Intune help register the device and deploy all the necessary
updates and changes.

Windows Autopilot and Intune MDM policies help you easily
control the desktop user experience. Different users perform different tasks
in their roles. To ensure that each user has all the apps ready and that
they can focus on the tasks of their role, IT administrators can
customize the Start menu. IT administrators are not able to granularly
control which setting the user has access to, but they can force certain
security policies to always be on.

When looking for documents, Windows has a great feature called Timeline
that remembers what you have been working on or sites you have been
visiting across all your devices, including iPhone and Android. Timeline
provides you with an opportunity to return to previous activities you
have worked on across your devices. Another great feature is the
Universal Clipboard with Clipboard History. This cloud-powered feature
can sync your clipboard across devices, meaning you could copy on your PC
and paste on another machine, including your mobile device, with the
SwiftKey keyboard.

Lately, the number of employee-owned devices in companies has
increased, and there exists a huge risk of inadvertent data loss through
various apps and services. Windows Information Protection (WIP)
helps to prevent a data breach, as well as accidental data loss on
enterprise-owned and personal devices.

### Shared device experiences

Firstline Workers roles often have very discrete tasks, and IT has
sometimes been challenged to provide appropriately controlled desktop
environments that keep staff focused by providing just the tools
necessary for the role. Assigned Access Multi-App Shared Device mode is
a capability in Windows 10 and when combined with Intune policies, can apply
policies to devices. This means the device can deliver a customized
shared device experience to certain users. There are many examples of
where a multi-app shared device can be used, including the reception area,
incoming goods, the customer service desk, and the staff room where a shared
device is provided for shared access.

Single Application Shared Devices are often used in public,
customer-facing situations, such as airport check-in kiosks, retail
kiosks, dedicated factory machines, digital signs, and other single-
task device scenarios. Firstline workers' roles are sometimes assigned
access, so devices can be configured in the cloud with Intune policies to a
single app.

Devices like kiosks and digital signs usually don't have user accounts
associated with them. Often, organizations will have staff devices that
need to only do one thing. These types of devices are often configured
as digital signs or customer-facing kiosks. In an organization where
staff do not require a PC to do their job, a company can choose to
configure kiosks in the staff room that are locked down to a single
application that they can use to do things like access their shift
scheduling system or access their HR data.

This Single App Shared Device mode runs above the lock screen outside of
the user context. The best practice is to make sure the app itself has a
user login, if required. It should also have a timeout to log the user
out if the app is going to present any confidential information. If an
employee walks away, the kiosk browser session will time out in one
minute and reset the session for the next kiosk user.

Windows 10 Pro is empowering for information workers, firstline workers,
and kiosks, with devices that are designed for sharing, and with performance
that's great for the life of the device. And they are simple, secure,
familiar, and efficient.
