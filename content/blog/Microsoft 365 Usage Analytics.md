usage information with metadata in the organization's Azure Active
Directory. This combination provides rich analytical capabilities to
reinforce usage insights for your company.

The dashboard helps you understand how Microsoft 365 solutions are used
in your company, as it provides specific usage insights to detect trends
about your organization's use of the services.

At the top of the report, you can immediately see user activity across
Microsoft 365 products and services, including active users versus
returning users and the total number of users assigned a Microsoft
subscription.

Adoption reports show an all-up summary of adoption trends and product
usage over time, so it is possible to see how users have adopted
Microsoft 365.

In the *Adoption overview* report, for example, you can examine how
usage of the individual services has changed month by month. The
report also shows the cumulative trend of the users who were active in
the product at least once.

With this information, you can identify the products where additional
user training is needed to increase adoption.

The *Communication* area shows you information about the various
communication techniques used in the organization. You can check the way
your employees are using email, Skype for Business, Teams, and Yammer to
cooperate with each other and get work done.

With new tools, you will know how users adopt each of the
communication-related products, and the most popular clients they use for
communication.

A collection of cards shows the way employees store files and work
together. You can also check on the number of users enabled and active,
and how their activity has altered month by month. This will help you
understand how content is used on the sites over time.

Power BI sharing lets you easily distribute the dashboard to anybody so
others can analyze and filter the data but cannot change the visuals
unless you grant permissions.

Microsoft 365 enables users to become more efficient and to cooperate
with others to get their work done. Microsoft 365 Usage Analytics in
Power BI combines the power of Microsoft 365 usage data and Azure Active
Directory data with the Power BI interactive analysis to provide
Microsoft 365 admins with richer usage insights.
