### Enhancing the experience of OneDrive

OneDrive for Business makes it easy to get back to all personal files
and the shared files in Microsoft 365. When working within the group's
files, it is possible to see the metadata for each item. These features
make it simple for the users to access all their files from one place,
without having to go and visit multiple sites -- all with a common
experience of working with files no matter where they're stored or
shared from. The users can compact the list, which reduces scrolling
through a long library, or they can set the view to Tiles. The Tile view
provides a brief preview of each file to get a clearer idea of what the
documents contain as opposed to looking through the list library. OneDrive is also
a place to view rich previews, and supports over 300 different file
types.

### Collaborating within Office documents

The *CE Annual Report.docx.* file enables the capability to comment and
leave feedback directly in the document. It is easy to share, edit, and
collaborate with others in the organization and quickly communicate with
them in various documents, including PowerPoint, with
`mentions. `
Mentions helps the user to loop in the right people and
maintain a good connection between the content and the comments
associated with the document. OneDrive for Business provides the ability
to block downloads on any individual file by simply enabling the toggle
for the feature. Upon accessing the document, viewers are notified with
a yellow bar across the top of the document letting them know that they
do not have permission to download or print the file. In fact, viewers
cannot even copy and paste text from the file into another location.

### Formatting SharePoint lists

The Retail site is one of the central hubs for a lot of organizations,
connecting all relevant documents and news related to promotional
campaigns to one location. As productivity is one of the main concerns
for those working within the Retail site, columns help them organize
specific information in list libraries so that members of a site can
quickly find and filter on items to see what they're looking for.
SharePoint helps the users to make helpful changes with simple
interactions. In the *Customer Status* column, they can format Boolean
values, like Yes, No, On hold, and Sent to a customer to display in
different colors. Other columns, like Customer and Display Ready, can
also be formatted to display easy-to-see colors so the most
important information is seen right away and without confusion. You can
also update any document in the library and add the address for the
Pilot Store location. Once entered, SharePoint will populate the
metadata across the document library and display a Bing map location
image. Preceding creating a more productive experience for the
team, it is possible to switch views to a customized list that was
created using JSON coding. This customized view simplifies the
list and shows only the most pertinent information. Having this option
available makes it even easier for viewers to see important data right
away. Now everyone who visits the site will be able to quickly see the
default view and find the most current statuses of the promotional
campaigns.

### Creating a SharePoint page for your team

SharePoint has simplified site and page creation with easy-to-use tools.
These tools speed up the processes and help to deliver a more visually
appealing site with all of the same relevant content for the team. From
here, it is very easy to update the layout of the page by adding a title
and an image to the banner. Adding text is simple too; all you need to
do is click the plus sign, either inside or under a section, and
choose the text webpart. Access to rich formatting right from within the
webpart allows the user to give each site a unique look every time. To
add something visual to the page, you can very easily add an image
gallery webpart and can choose from images in various locations, like a
website location. It is possible to do a quick web search as well, or
even upload an image from personal folders.

The flexibility of SharePoint page creation enables employees to share
with their team in the most dynamic and productive way. SharePoint pages
are helpful for the team when looking for specific information
pertaining to a certain topic. SharePoint page creation helps the user
create customized layouts and composite apps with simple code so that
each site and page is fully unique and functions in the most effective
way for their team. SharePoint's feature capabilities can be used and
customized by end users, coders, or those in between.

### Bringing SharePoint and Microsoft Teams together

Staying connected to everyone in the organization is important and now,
with SharePoint integration with Microsoft Teams, that connection is
even stronger. Microsoft has made a lot of improvements in terms of how
Teams function for users. First, the Files tab for each Teams channel
is backed by SharePoint. The files are stored in the connected
SharePoint team site document library, with every folder associated with a
channel. What's more is that Microsoft Teams Files can now be synced
the same as Files in OneDrive.

Another improvement is the ability to add SharePoint pages to a Teams
channel. This would then showcase a list of available pages and lists
that you can easily click to add as tabs in Teams. This list helps
keep track of all the stores that are still in need of the retail
displays for the season, and it's vital that the team has the most updated
information. This SharePoint List now within Teams displays as it does
from within the SharePoint site, with all of the metadata, formatted
columns, and even custom formatting. SharePoint also makes it easy to
catch up on news articles made in the Retail team site.

To keep your team updated, you should add a News tab. Then each
published SharePoint news article in Teams flows into the conversation
feed. SharePoint News is a great way to connect and engage with others
within the group by providing relevant and relatable content.

### Microsoft 365 mobile experience

Staying connected across devices is important because it allows
employees to be productive while they are outside of the office. With
Microsoft 365 apps, you can stay ahead of your work tasks wherever you
are. Outlook is essential when communicating with colleagues and clients
and accessing all of the files.

The Outlook mobile app allows users to attach any document from
OneDrive, Team sites, and Outlook Groups. This capability makes it easy
to select the necessary document, right from the document
library. Once attached, a link to the document or file is inserted into
Outlook and is functional to everyone with access to the link.

The SharePoint mobile app now gives you the ability to browse document
libraries without having to leave the app. From one location, you can
sift through all the site's files in SharePoint and Teams without
leaving the SharePoint mobile site. This kind of connectivity greatly
enhances productivity and always keeps all the content safe and
available.

No two teams are the same and with SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, and
OneDrive, you can now build the collaboration experience that's right
for your organization.
