Microsoft Power Automate automates many common business processes and
tasks, including instantly responding to high-priority notifications or
emails, capturing, tracking, and following up with new sales leads,
copying email attachments and saving them to OneDrive for Business, and
collecting business data and sharing that information with team members.

With Microsoft Power Automate, there is no need to build your workflow
from scratch. Microsoft Power Automate has an extensive library of
templates, many accessible directly from SharePoint lists, which tackle
common business scenarios and reduce time to deployment -- including the
*Start approval when a new item is added template.*

Organizations commonly implement approval processes to ensure that
business functions such as budgeting, marketing initiatives, invoicing,
and creative projects meet quality or target standards.

The *Start an approval action* automatically notifies the person
responsible for approval or rejection of a new design idea posted to the
Design Ideas list via email or via the Microsoft Power Automate mobile
app. The approval process can be simple, with one person responsible for
approving or denying a request, or it can be extended to include multiple
approvers. A common multiple-approver business scenario is an employee
vacation request that must be approved by both the requestor's manager
and their skip-level manager. You could also list multiple approvers, yet
only require the approval of one. No matter the level of complexity,
Microsoft Power Automate makes approval process design quick and simple.

*The Start approval when a new item* is added template includes an
action to *Inform the item creator of rejection by default*. The
rejection email includes the title of the design idea and status on the
subject line, with a brief message informing who the approving party
was and any additional comments. Allowing the approving stakeholder to
comment upon a rejected idea presents opportunity to elicit additional
information, such as designs or documentation, further elaboration upon
the idea, or feedback to the submitting team member. Again, Microsoft
Power Automate makes giving and receiving feedback seamless and nearly
instantaneous.

You can quickly expand the template by adding approver email
address(es), including other stakeholders on the CC or BCC lines,
adding attachments, or flagging the email as important -- all in a few
clicks.

Microsoft Power Automate increases your efficiency and effectiveness by
allowing you to instantly check your newly saved workflow for missing
data, values, and errors so the other members of your team will not be
inconvenienced or frustrated by a broken workflow.

The Microsoft Power Automate mobile app enables you to approve or reject
new design ideas while on the go. In addition to push notifications
alerting of a new approval request, you can view the details of the idea
in a format suited to your device.

It is very easy to build a simple workflow that automatically generates
an approval email when a new item is added to a SharePoint list, updates
that list, notifies the submitting user when the idea item is approved
or rejected, and posts idea details from the list item to a Microsoft
Teams channel. Seeing the new idea in Teams, members can start
collaboration and send feedback to refine it or post new ideas on
their own. This simple workflow could easily be extended to a more
complex scenario, such as multiple or serial approval stakeholders or
distribution of idea details across a broader team. This could result in
improved response time by stakeholders and transcendence of team silos
within the organization, fostering increased collaboration and
innovation.
