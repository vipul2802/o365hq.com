Having a single provider for all your communications simplifies your
phone system management and saves your time and money while there is no
need to pay for complex and high-cost telephony equipment anymore.
Microsoft Teams combines calling with chat and meetings and links your
contacts and calendar across Team and Outlook. Calls between employees
within your company are managed internally with Phone System, even if
users are in different geographical regions. For external calls Phone
System can be connected to the PSTN using a Microsoft Calling Plan or
Direct Routing.

*Direct Routing* is the right choice for larger enterprises that use an
existing PSTN connection via a Session Border Controller (SBC) hardware
device that links to Microsoft Teams. With the help of Direct Routing
you can:

-   Link existing telecom providers and numbers to Teams virtually
    anywhere for full-feature calling.
-   Use existing phone numbers without porting them.
-   Manage complex global calling requirements of large multinational
    organizations.
-   Guarantee safety for your cloud-calling deployment

*Microsoft Calling Plan* is a cloud solution option that provides your
employees with a phone number and an opportunity to arrange calls with
features such as hold, and blind and safe transfers. Unified with Phone
System in Microsoft 365 a calling plan can become the voice solution for
your entire organization.

Microsoft Calling Plans exist in different sizes depending upon the
number of minutes needed and allow you to:

-   Purchase calling plans for supported countries and assign to users
    in the Microsoft 365 Teams admin portal.
-   Port existing numbers and request new numbers.
-   Experience a fast, 100 % cloud deployment with Microsoft as your
    sole provider.
-   Manage Calling Plans from round the world and provide easy
    management.

Calling Plans are easily added to Teams and provide standard telephone
features, such as call answering and initiating with integrated dial
pad, call holding and forwarding, call history, voicemail, and emergency
calling. It is also possible to handle all of this using the Teams app
on your laptop, tablet, and smartphone to stay always up to sate even
when on the go.

Once you have chosen between a Calling Plan, Direct Routing, or a
combination to make and receive calls, your organization will need to
use a phone system as part of E5 or acquire as an add-on.

Microsoft has worked hard to build a subscription service in the cloud
to help you get rid of expensive equipment at your office location. The
telephone capabilities in Microsoft 365 help you and your team stay
connected from anywhere in the world as long as you have internet
access.
