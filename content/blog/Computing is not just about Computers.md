Teams launched worldwide in March 2017 and has seen multiple updates
since, including education features, guest access, and tighter app
integration. At Ignite, Microsoft proudly shared new capabilities of
Teams.

### Background blur

Now, all Teams customers can remove distractions and focus your video on
what matters most. Available today. (You are welcome, BBC Dad.)

### Meeting recording

Meetings are no longer just a point-in-time experience. With meeting
recording in Teams, you or other invitees who missed the meeting can
play back recorded audio, video, and content at any time. Pull up a
transcript, powered by Microsoft Stream, and search for keywords so you
can optimize your time while getting caught up. Available today.

### Cloud video interop

Bring your existing room technology investments into Teams. Through
partner offerings from Polycom, BlueJeans, and Pexip, a full portfolio of
legacy devices can now be full-fledged audio/video participants in Teams
meetings with content sharing. Polycom's CVI offering is
available now, with Pexip and BlueJeans generally available by the end of
October.
