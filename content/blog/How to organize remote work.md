### User identity and access

It all starts with managing identities. Whether they are an employee,
partner, or supplier, every user who needs to access the corporate
network should receive a primary account synced to Azure Active
Directory (Azure AD). To enable a single user identity for
authentication and offer a unified experience, you may integrate
on-premises Windows Server Active Directory with Azure Active Directory
(Azure AD).

### Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

MFA is required. When a user connects remotely using their work
credentials on a device that you manage (more below about that), MFA
is almost transparent.

### Managing devices

With Microsoft Cloud solutions you can manage a wide range of devices,
including Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android. With more employees
working remotely and across devices, it's important to support
bring-your-own-device (BYOD) scenarios. Microsoft offers
self-service enrollment so users can quickly and easily join Azure AD
and access company resources.

### Productivity applications

With this foundation in place, we are driving our employees to work in
the cloud. Microsoft 365 enables users to access resources and share
files with Office apps across the web, mobile, and desktop, storing
their content in the cloud by default. Outlook mobile, Microsoft Teams,
and OneDrive are deployed on all corporate devices so people can access
their emails, calendars, and files within File Explorer on Windows,
Finder on Mac, and Office Apps on mobile devices. We can make it easy
for users to save their files to OneDrive the same way they
traditionally saved files to their C: drive; this has been key to
getting files to the cloud. Users are also now able to do real-time
coauthoring and commenting on documents in the cloud, which has proved
extremely useful for a distributed workforce.

### Meetings and collaboration

Microsoft Teams is key for chat, meetings, calls, and collaboration.
Now that we find ourselves working remotely, we've been able to stay
productive because we are accustomed to a digital workspace. Every
meeting is now a Teams meeting, often with video. We can use features
like background blur to block out our naughty kids, our barking dogs,
and our mismatched furniture. As we rally to help our customers prepare
for remote work, we've found that the ability to record meetings has
become essential. All attendees can access recordings of meetings
they've missed and then listen in to the most relevant parts.

### Service monitoring

With the increased load and usage from so many people working remotely,
service monitoring has proven crucial to making sure everything is
operating as it should. Office 365 and Microsoft 365 carefully monitor
application and network performance.

Enabling a team to work remotely is an ongoing challenge, and we get
that this challenge is different for every organization.
