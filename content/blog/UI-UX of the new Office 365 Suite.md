**Designing for Power & Simplicity. How we evolved the Microsoft Office
365 user experience to support a more simple, powerful, and intelligent
suite of connected products.** He explained what Microsoft 365 and Office
will look like with the new UI.

Tendril was approached to conceptualize and create a film for the Microsoft
Ignite Conference that showcased the simple, powerful, and intelligent
UI/UX of the new Microsoft 365 Suite.

Also, Tendril dove deep into the software, constructing and
deconstructing the various advancements into an animated visual
language.
