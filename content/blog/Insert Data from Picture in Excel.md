With Insert Data from Picture, you can take a picture of a hand-drawn or
printed data table with your Android device and convert that analog
information into an Excel spreadsheet with a single click. New image
recognition functionality automatically converts the picture to a fully
editable table in Excel, eliminating the need for you to manually enter
data. Insert Data from Picture will be available in preview for the
Excel Android app soon.
