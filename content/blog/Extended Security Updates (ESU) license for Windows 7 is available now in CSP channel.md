We are happy to announce that [Windows 7 Extended Security Updates
(ESU) 2020
SKU](https://buymssoft.com/license/CSP-DG7GMGF0FL73-0002 "p/n: CSP-DG7GMGF0FL73-0002")
is available on Buymssoft.com for purchase for
\$62^[1]^ per year. The price will
increase in 2021.

Extended Security Updates (ESU) for Windows 7 have been available for
some time through specific volume licensing programs, like EA
(Enterprise Agreement). It was a problem because not every organization
was eligible for one. But since December 2, 2019, you can purchase
Windows 7 ESU SKUs in CSP channel. There is
no minimum order.

### Purchasing Windows 7 ESUs through a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)

The process is very simple:

1.  Contact your manager and ask about Windows 7 ESUs.
2.  Let them know the number of licenses that you would like to purchase
    (per device).
3.  Provide your Azure AD (Office 365) Tenant Name ([What is the Office
    365/Azure AD
    tenant](https://o365hq.com/faq/what-is-office-365-or-azure-ad-tenant)).
4.  Receive your invoice and make a payment.
5.  Receive your keys and install them.

Alternatively, just place an order via our website
[here](https://buymssoft.com/license/CSP-DG7GMGF0FL73-0002).

2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2, we recommend that you take the steps

^[1]^ The original price for Win 7
ESU was \$50. But on Dec 10, 2019, it was increased to \$62.
We got this communication from Microsoft:\
"UPDATE: Windows 7 ESU in CSP -- Pricing\
On December 2, Windows 7 Extended Security Updates (ESU) were
made available to businesses of all sizes through Cloud Solution
Provider (CSP).\
We have identified a price discrepancy with the Windows 7 Extended
Security Updates available through the CSP channel. As of
Tuesday, December 10, we have fixed the discrepancy to ensure that all
commercial customers have the same suggested retail price for the
Windows 7 ESU. Now, the ESU price that CSP
partners see will align to the pricing offered through our volume
licensing channel since April 2019."
