You can easily access files most recently opened and those shared with
you by other people. The *Discover* view, powered by the Microsoft
Graph, offers the most relevant content based on who you work with and
the files they are viewing and editing to which you also have access.
The *Search* box allows users to search for files by name or a term. It
is also possible to navigate directly to document libraries in
SharePoint sites without leaving the OneDrive for Business user
interface.

The OneDrive mobile app is used to access the same content from a phone.
Within folders, items are viewed with details or as tile previews. By
tapping the *Search* icon at the top, you can search for files and get
results from across OneDrive for Business folders and sites you follow.
In the *Recent* tab, you can access the files you most recently opened
and in the *Shared* tab, you can work with files that have been shared
with you by other people.

The OneDrive mobile app helps users manage their files easily. Displaying a
top toolbar allows you to download that file, move it to a different
location, and more. If you need to update that document while on a
plane, you can take that document offline now and work on it later while
disconnected from the network.

Office Lens technology integrated into the OneDrive app allows users to
scan a business card, document, or whiteboard, and then have the
resulting image formatted nicely into a PDF file that can be
subsequently uploaded to a OneDrive for Business folder. You might
consider using this capability with business travel receipts or forms
that need to be printed and signed. Now, you can share it with others
from within your secure and reliable Microsoft 365 environment.

The OneDrive mobile app provides you with rich native PDF
capabilities. When you tap the business card you just scanned, you can
view that PDF file in high fidelity directly in the phone's
browser. In the top toolbar, when you tap the edit icon, you can add
text, notes, inking, and photos. Others on the team can now see that
note in the saved version of the PDF file.

As with the OneDrive for Business desktop browser experience, you can
navigate to SharePoint sites or follow in the OneDrive mobile app.

From the *Me* tab, the OneDrive mobile app provides access to the
content from across all the accounts, including any files you may have
stored in your personal OneDrive.

In the *Active Files* area, you can see a listing of files that have
generated recent activity, including the number of user views for each
file. When you tap any file in that area, you can analyze viewing trends
over time.

Below the *Active Files* area, you can tap *Offline Files* to review the
list of files you have taken offline for use when you are disconnected
from the network.
