Microsoft Compliance Score offers more than 10 out-of-box assessments
that facilitate risk management around data security. The score involves
key regulations and standards for data protection and general data
governance. It is easy to check your score breakdown by category, such
as data security, govern info, and manage devices. It is simple to assign
tasks to the admins who specialize in a specific area to enhance the
category score. With the help of the solution page, you can observe your
remaining points and improvement actions to decide on the solutions that
require immediate attention.

The assessment page contains the assessments that measure the compliance
readiness of a product against a regulation or a standard, and offers a
clear view of the number of actions managed by customers and by
Microsoft.

With Compliance Manager, it is simple to search for the action you are
looking for and assign it to your colleague. The built-in workflow tool
lets you collaborate across teams using Compliance Score. You can also
upload evidence and other relevant supporting documentation attached to
the action here, as well as add your implementation details here as a
record.

Another very powerful capability in Compliance Score is the built-in
control mapping. As regulation and standards evolve rapidly, with more
than 220 updates from 1,000 regulatory bodies every day, it's very
challenging for enterprises to stay updated with the landscape. With
this feature, organizations can better scale their compliance program to
meet multiple requirements with one action.

Microsoft Compliance Score allows you to evaluate your data security
controls with a risk-based score, receive assistance on how to reduce
compliance risk and enhance your data protection controls, as well as
leverage the built-in control mapping to scale your compliance program.
