## CALL CONFIGURATION

In Teams, it is possible to place one-on-one or group calls directly from chat, from the command bar, from the calling tab, and basically anywhere you interact with the person you want to call. These calls are private and won`t appear in any team conversation. You can also easily start a new call from someone`s profile card or from a command box at the top of your screen and type/call, then type or select the name of the person you want to reach.

If you wish to reach someone who is not in your contacts list, go to *Calls*, click *Dial* a number, and then enter the number by using the dial pad. You can also add a person to a call in Teams by selecting *Show participants* in your call controls and typing their name or phone number in the search box.

If you are already on a call, you can still answer or start a new call anytime. With Teams you can always put your current call on hold and join a new one. While a call is on hold, all participants will be notified, and they won`t be able to see or hear you. All your on-hold calls display on the left side of your call window, so you can get back to them anytime. If you need to transfer a call, Choose *More options > Transfer* in your call controls. It is also possible to check in with someone before you transfer a call to them. Under *Choose a person to consult*, start typing the name of the person you want to reach and select them when they appear. You can call them or consult with them over chat.
