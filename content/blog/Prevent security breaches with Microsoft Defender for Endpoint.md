Microsoft Defender for Endpoint continuously checks the network for malicious activity using the following combination of technology built into Windows 10 and robust cloud services:

1. Behavior sensors: built-in sensors gather and process behavioral signals from the operating system. The sensor data is sent to your private, isolated, cloud instance of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
2. Cloud security analytics: big-data and unique Microsoft optics analyze the information received from the sensors and allow behavioral signals to translate into insights, detections, and recommended responses to advanced threats.
3. Threat intelligence: Microsoft security team together with partners provide threat intelligence to enable Defender for Endpoint to discover attacker tools, techniques and generate alerts when they are observed in collected sensor data.

Defender for Endpoint includes a wide range of capabilities:
