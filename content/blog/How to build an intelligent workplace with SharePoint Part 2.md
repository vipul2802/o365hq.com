### Employee engagement and communications

Home site is intended to become an official organizational site, based on
four pillars:

-   Giving personalized news and content
-   Seamlessly baking in social and video into the site with Yammer
    and Stream
-   Providing efficient search and navigation (especially important for
    companies with multiple sites)
-   Providing a great user experience on the web and mobile that
    addresses modern accessibility needs.

Home sites show what main communicators in the organization have to
share, together with the information personally relevant to users, based
on their job. An administrator can mark certain sites as
"authoritative," and their content will be displayed on the home site.
The news may be highlighted with visual cues to distinguish the
organizational enterprise-wide news from other news.

blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-SharePoint-Blog/SharePoint-home-sites-a-landing-for-your-organization-on-the/ba-p/621933)
) \_

Embedded videos give you rich and dynamic content, and conversations
inside the home site provide two-way dialogue. From the home site, you
can have access to information across the whole digital estate.

This home site can be built in minutes as opposed to months, as admin
turns a certain communication site into a home site granting it
"superpowers" like:

-   My SharePoint link, which brings you to the user's SharePoint start page
-   One-click return to the home site by pressing the logo of the
    company, as company branding follows the user in most apps (this
    superpower should be set by admin)
-   Tenant-wide search in the header

*"Superpowers" of the home site*

Building sites is quick, but there are tools to make it even quicker. One
of these tools is [SharePoint Online Provisioning
Service](https://provisioning.sharepointpnp.com/) . It allows you to simply
deploy samples and solutions and customize them to meet your needs. We
encourage you to check it out!

The world of 3D is transforming perception with [SharePoint
spaces](https://www.exploresharepointspaces.com/) . It empowers users to
create a mixed reality experience within the intranet on any device. Employees
can interact with content in real time, viewing it from different angles
and manipulating the models. It's pretty impressive, and may be
utilized for training and education, as well as report visualization.

### Search and content intelligence

It's no secret that AI is the hottest area in technology these days.
Microsoft is working hard to be on the forefront, not just investing in
AI, but making it relevant and helpful for people navigating information
and automating business processes. A specific component in this is
Microsoft search and the next generation of content intelligence
capabilities built on top of it. It's different from enterprise search
in two aspects:

-   The relevance is fundamentally better. It's not another
    sophisticated ranking algorithm, it's a breakthrough. Machine
    learning examines all the content, signals, activity, and social
    graph to not just build an optimum model, but to refine it every day,
    making it far more relevant.
-   There's an open source repository built inside Microsoft for internal open
    source, where teams from across the company are contributing to the
    shared user experience that is hosted in different apps (Bing,
    Office, Teams, Yammer, and surely SharePoint).

All the search boxes in the Office apps and SharePoint home page are
built on the new technology of Microsoft search, so when looking for a
company's documents, locations, regulations, or employees, you will get
the same experience across different apps. At the top of your search
list you may see administrator-curated answers, the most relevant from
the admin's perspective. These can be configured to vary by the users'
country or region to provide search results applicable to their
geography.

### Conclusion

The digital era has resulted in a step change in technological
opportunities, in new capabilities, as well as new concerns of how
society and organizations can adapt.

It is essential today for businesses to embrace a pace of change in
technology. In order to do this, you've got to make investments, and the
ecosystem of partners is here to assist you in all phases of planning,
migration, and adoption. Partners have far more depth and breadth to
tailor their services and to meet customers' needs from migration to
application development, training, culture change, and much more.
