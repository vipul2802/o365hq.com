Microsoft 365 Business is a great and affordable solution not only to
increase productivity, but to enhance security as well. Here are simple
steps that will help organizations using Microsoft 365 Business plan to
stay on the safe side.

### Training users (employees)

The biggest threat by far to any Internet user today is human
interaction. "Social engineers" are people of ideas -- they may send an
email or even make a phone call, convincing the target they are from a
reputable company and tricking the victim into handing over sensitive
information. So the best you can do to secure your organization is:

-   build a culture of security awareness, informing your users
    about most common threats
-   follow the ultimate rule: "Think before you click" (or give out any
    important information)
-   make absolutely certain that you're on the website you think you're
    on, or that people you're talking to are who they say they are --
    and if you can't be certain, hang up. It's simply never worth the
    risk.

You can start your training by reading [how to protect yourself from
phishing schemes and other forms of online
fraud.](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/protect-yourself-from-phishing-schemes-and-other-forms-of-online-fraud-be0de46a-29cd-4c59-aaaf-136cf177d593)

### Check out your organization's Secure Score

Secure score gives you a view of the organization's security posture. This indicator is
determined for each organization automatically and shows how it is doing in
terms of security. The Secure Score also provides an analysis of possible
threats and gives recommendations on how to improve the situation and
get a better score. You can choose which recommendations to follow at
what time, so it's very flexible and depends on the company's needs.

### Start using multi-factor authentication (MFA)

Two-step authentication is one of the simplest methods to protect an
account, because even if hackers get hold of a password, the second
layer of defense will still protect the account, because it uses:

-   something you have (like your smartphone) or something you are
    (like your face or fingerprint).\
    If your company is using Microsoft 365, then MFA is already
    there. At the same time, if you make security hard, people will work
    around it, so MFA should be implemented with the right
    model. It is possible to start with a couple of employees and [set
    up
    MFA](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/security-and-compliance/set-up-multi-factor-authentication?view=o365-worldwide)
    for them, giving them the option to approve their identity using:
-   secondary email address
-   phone number (to receive a phone call or a message with the secret
    code)
-   authenticator app

It is always up to you and your users to decide how to deploy
MFA in the most convenient way. Sometimes, however, it might take
time and effort to puzzle out the settings, so our specialists [will gladly help you](o365hq.com/services/free-office-365-security-assessment-service)
in case you need advice.

### Check out your admin accounts

Keep in mind that administrative accounts include more privileges and
thus naturally present more valuable targets for hackers. So admin
account should be:

-   well-protected (in this case, MFA is surely a must)
-   used only for administrative functions
-   used only when all unrelated applications, websites, and accounts are
    closed
-   logged out of the browser session once the admin is done with their tasks

### Protect against spam and malware

Microsoft 365 already has built-in malware and spam filters, but there's no
limit to perfection, and you can additionally:

-   set an anti-malware policy that will block attachments most often used
    by hackers. To do this, follow the instructions in the picture below
-   fine-tune your Exchange Online or EOP (already included in
    Microsoft 365 Business Basic and Business Premium plans) to make
    your organization an unassailable fortress for malware and spam
    attacks. See here if you want to learn more. It might be a little
    tricky, so [don't hesitate to reach out.](o365hq.com/services/free-office-365-security-assessment-service)

### Protect against ransomware

Ransomware is a malignant piece of code that may block access to your
corporate data, attachments, or devices, and demand a ransom (most commonly
in cryptocurrency) to restore the access. But organizations won't
necessarily regain their access even if the money is paid, so it's
obviously better to prevent this type of threat than to deal with the
consequences. You can prevent it from happening by:

-   educating users that the first and most important rule states that
    ransomware is downloaded through executables (most common are the following
    file types: ade, exe, pif) and files supporting macros (like
    doc, xls, docm, xlsm, pptm), but if they are part of your
    business correspondence, warn your users about the risk and train
    them to always be watchful of anything suspicious
-   creating backup copies of your files
-   creating mail flow rules to [block some attachment
    types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/inspect-message-attachments)

![](https://o365hq.com/images/195.png)

### Disable mail auto-forwarding

Auto-forwarding may result in data leakage or even data loss, so it is
safer to turn off this capability for your employees. Creating a
transport rule blocking any auto-forward message types is among the
simplest and handiest ways to do it. The following
[article](https://docs.microsoft.com/ru-ru/archive/blogs/exovoice/disable-automatic-forwarding-in-office-365-and-exchange-server-to-prevent-information-leakage)
can give you a better idea on how it works.

### Enable mailbox auditing

The information pointing out who was logging in, sending emails or
performing other mailbox activities may turn out to be very useful for
identifying suspicious behavior and possibly showing that an account was
compromised. So if you want to keep up with various mailbox activities,
you will need to [enable mailbox
auditing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/securitycompliance/enable-mailbox-auditing)
in Microsoft 365 and get the full picture.
