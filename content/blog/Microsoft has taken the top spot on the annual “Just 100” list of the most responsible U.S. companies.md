The Redmond, Washington-based software giant scored highly in a range of
categories, notably:

1.  Minimizing environmental impact (\#1)
2.  Paying workers fairly (\#2)
3.  Treating customers well (\#5)
4.  Committing to ethical and diverse leadership (\#5)

Microsoft unseated last year's No. 1 pick, Intel, which landed in second
place for 2018. Google's parent company Alphabet took third. Other
Seattle-area companies to make the list were Amazon (\#30), Zillow
(\#69), and Boeing (\#72).

Forbes and Just Capital looked at 890 publicly traded US companies for
the ranking. 

Social responsibility appeared to help, not hurt, the financial
performance of most firms. Those that made the list reported 5 percent
higher return-on-equity than the average of Russell 1000 companies.
