The so-called FAANG firms --- Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix,
and Google --- all finished last Monday in the red as the sell-off
deepened. It was the continuation of a downward spiral that has run for
weeks.

Excluded from the FAANG group, Microsoft has outperformed those
stocks since the start of October as investors bet that spending from
businesses for cloud services and software will remain strong. After
years of derision for missing opportunities in markets such as digital
advertising and social media, Microsoft now finds itself more insulated
from the regulatory and data privacy scrutiny aimed at Facebook Inc. and
Alphabet Inc.'s Google. Microsoft gained as much as 2 percent on
Wednesday.

Microsoft is also expected to become one of the next companies worth
more than \$1 trillion.
