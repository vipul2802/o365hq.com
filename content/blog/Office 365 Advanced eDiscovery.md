### Security & Compliance Center: Case Creation

The need for organizational search is becoming very prevalent. Advanced
eDiscovery in Microsoft 365 offers an excellent opportunity to control
information requests, whether it is litigation, internal investigations,
responding to a regulatory request, or policy obligation. Advanced
eDiscovery makes it easy to create a case, add case members, put
custodians on hold, send hold notifications, cull, check the content, and
export it when needed. Once the case has been created, it is possible to
configure case settings. The Settings tab is used to configure search
analytics within the case level.

Using custodian management and communications makes it simple to control
the eDiscovery workflow around identifying, collecting, and preserving
potentially relevant data. After adding custodians, a workflow will
configure the data sources connected with the person that are important
to monitor and place a hold on the custodians. Companies can run their
legal workflow around custodian communications from within Advanced
eDiscovery in the Compliance Center.

It is easy to customize the hold notification workflows and content to
meet the organization's needs. Templates are used here to create
generally used connections, escalate with reminders, and control
notifications. While creating these notifications, it is possible to add
links and ensure that custodians acknowledge receiving this information.

A rich text editor is provided to create the Hold Notice, and variables
are available that can be used to create the notice. The admin can
define if this is a new issuance, re-issue, or release of hold for the
communication and define the content within the hold, as well as utilize
common variables such as display name, acknowledgment link, and more.

Using the Custodians tab, users can view a custodian's activity. This
can be used to search and identify a custodian's activity over time.

### Searches

After creating the case and adding the custodians and their associated data
sources, the next step is to search for relevant content to start to
build out case-related content.

After executing a search, you can use the Statistics and Preview options to
verify the search you created is collecting the type of data you need.
Statistics provides a quick view of the location of the results of your
search and how many documents were found in those locations. The preview
provides a quick view of search results for early validation that you
are on the right track. After you are satisfied with the results of the
search, you can evaluate the content further by moving it into a working
set.

### Working set management

A working set helps improve performance and stability of working with
your content after you have validated the initial search results. With
the working set, organizations can take an early pass at reducing
content with queries and conditions, reviewing content in place, and
tagging content with a customizable coding panel.

Adding the results of your search to a working set triggers the
collection process.

-   Advanced eDiscovery is going to collect all the content from your
    search results.
-   It will process all that content by extracting the metadata.
-   The results will be placed in a centralized index.
-   These results can then be searched through one interface.

As part of the working set, you can configure a customizable tagging
panel for early review activities, including custom tags for further
triage of the data included in the working set. This helps reviewers
with early classification and culling of data to get to only the most
relevant set of data.

A Working Set can include multiple collections of data. These
collections are called *Load Sets*. Each *Load Set* represents an
individual collection loaded into the working set, whether loaded from
Microsoft 365, Non-Microsoft 365 data, or another working set.

When data is loaded from Microsoft 365, you can compare Load Sets from
similar searches to understand what data was added from each load set.
Select Compare Load Sets to gain further insights into differences in
load sets within a working set. In many cases, organizations will need
to include data from sources other than Microsoft 365. In order to do that,
Advanced eDiscovery offers a process for uploading that content.

### Review and tagging

Now that documents are collected, it is easy to analyze, review, and
organize the content. It is necessary to run analysis first to minimize
the number of documents you need to check, and query within a working
set to find the set of documents you want to review. If the documents
contain sensitive information, you may want to redact those parts. You
can tag documents for further action.

After a Working Set is created, queries can be created to start
consuming the analytics data. You can create a search that only displays
unique documents and suppresses all duplicates and noise. If two users
are going back and forth 50 times, all the emails aren't displayed, just
a couple of emails, inclusive of the email thread, reducing all the
noise. Creating a query lets you start viewing the data in themes by
letting the system sort the content into buckets for easier review.

By iterating the searches, you can narrow your focus to the content of
interest. The review experience provides options to maintain the various
ways your team accesses content. It is possible to take a look at the
content in a viewer in the document's native format. While viewing the
document you can redact content, allowing you to export the content with
some of the data redacted.

Moreover, with the help of the customizable coding panel, it is easy to
ensure that you can tag and organize the content under review. Any
process in Advanced eDiscovery that takes more than a few seconds is
created as a job. The Jobs tab tracks the status of jobs that are
running or have been completed.

### Errors and export

Sometimes, the Microsoft 365 services are unable to fully index a file. A
common example of this is when a file is password protected. Error
remediation allows you to fix errors and add the corrected files back
into the system so the files can be processed as if the problem never
occurred. In some cases, it's not necessary to remediate errors, but it's
important to simply report the errors that were encountered. The Errors
tab lists all errors that were encountered and further breaks down the
errors by file count and includes the number of items and the size.

In some cases, a lawyer or another third party may just need to download
five documents from a case for a specific deposition, and in that case,
we provide the download option. For bigger volumes, you can use the
export option. You have several options for how to export the content;
choose the one that makes the most sense in your context and export the
relevant content to enable the next steps of your process.

Microsoft 365 Advanced eDiscovery enables companies to quickly find relevant
emails and information across large quantities of stored email and
document content. Even if stored in the cloud, Advanced eDiscovery
streamlines discovery and analysis processes, allowing organizations to
respond to requests in a timely manner. Whether it is litigation,
internal investigation, responding to a regulatory request, or policy
obligation -- you'll be able to find relevant content, refine that
content, and prepare it to be handed off to the requesting body in an
efficient and productive way.
