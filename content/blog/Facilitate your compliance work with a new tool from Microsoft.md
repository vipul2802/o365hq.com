description = "In day-to-day life, company compliance is a necessary evil. According to research, there are more than 200 updates from 750 regulatory bodies every day – a huge burden for employees to stay up-to-date with all these changes. Even when compliance and privacy officers know the legal guidelines and internal policies well enough, they don't know which technology solutions can help them meet the conditions. On the other hand, IT professionals know about the technology and how to use features like Data Loss Prevention and e-Discovery, but they don't know how to go about managing these features and compliance regulations."

The lack of connection between the Compliance and IT departments is
another barrier for successful work. In the meantime, it is still not
enough just to understand the rules and bring your environment into
accordance with them; you have to demonstrate results to the auditors.
Collecting all this data for the report is quite a challenge and a very
time-consuming process.

Sound familiar? Don't get stressed out. You are not alone. When you move to the cloud, you set your foot on the
territory of a joint responsibility between you and your service
provider.

![](https://o365hq.com/images/239.png)

And as you see here, your degree of responsibility varies and is defined
by the services you consume. If you're utilizing something like Office
365, or Dynamics 365, your provider takes care of most compliance
requirements. To arrange for the rest, a handy tool named Compliance
Manager is just the ticket. The picture below shows what services and
standards are supported (and more are planned to be added):

![](https://o365hq.com/images/240.png)

### What can this tool do for you?

It is designed to meet all the challenges described above. It can:

1.  Asses a company's risk profile. With a single dashboard,
    organizations can see multiple assessments and measure their
    performance with a Compliance Score;
2.  Give information on how your provider puts into action controls
    under its responsibility and tests them by independent third-party
    auditors;
3.  Provide a recommended action plan and step-by-step instructions to
    take care of customer-managed controls and bring your environment in
    line with the rules and standards;
4.  Provide one place for all employees responsible for conformity
    issues to monitor, assign, note, and view each other's actions;
5.  Allow organizations to export incredibly detailed reports to be
    further demonstrated to auditors and regulators.

Please remember though that this tool is intended to help you, not do 
the work for you. It only provides recommendations, and
following these recommendations is not a guarantee of compliance. You
get tools and information to perform self-service risk assessments, but
ensuring that your company adheres to legal standards and in-house
policies remains your personal responsibility.

### How can you get this tool?

Compliance Manager can be found on a [Service Trust
Portal](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/) web page (STP).
Let's start with a little navigation around this site. It's a free
resource where you can find various documentation, white papers, and
instructions that may be helpful in protecting your infrastructure. There
is currently a privacy area on this site that explains what
GDPR is and what you can do to have effective data rights
management strategies enforced and become GDPR compliant.
STP has also started highlighting very good external resources
concerning compliance, so you will surely find it very useful.

To access Compliance Manager, you will have to login to your cloud
services or create a trial tenant and get this tool very quickly and
completely free of charge.

When may this be useful to you?

There are different cases when this tool can be applicable:

1.  When you are doing your due diligence and evaluate Microsoft Cloud
    against other cloud service providers, information from STP
    helps to understand how Microsoft Cloud will support your security
    and risk policies.
2.  Once you have moved to the cloud, this tool will help to protect your
    data and stay compliant.
3.  If you are in the regulated industry, you can have a one-stop portal
    where you can get all the information you need to perform your
    annual risk assessment.
4.  If you are renewing the cloud and want to understand how Microsoft Cloud
    can continue to support your industry and regional needs, you will
    get that information on STP as well.

This tool allows you to create assessments. Some of them are already
there, but you can continue to create more tiles on the dashboard to
evaluate the regulations that matter to you, your region, and your
industry. Simply click "Add assessment" and use an existing group or create a
new one and enter its name.

![](https://o365hq.com/images/242.png)

Then you can select whether you need data from your existing group.
Let's say in 2017 you created an assessment, and you have collected
all the results and desk plans. You can copy all the desk plans
and evidence that you have gathered and implement it into your next year's
assessment so you don't have to recreate it. Simply upload it
into your new assessment.

![](https://o365hq.com/images/245.png)

Once you copy the existing assessment, you'll be asked which Microsoft
product you want to evaluate (in this example, we are going to select
Office 365) against what certification (we will choose HIPAA).

![](https://o365hq.com/images/244.png)

When you are done, a new tile appears on the dashboard.

![](https://o365hq.com/images/246.png)

This group tile you created is showing 65 actions implemented by the
service provider and 36 actions recommended to the organization. Each of
these is scored, and the score signifies that out of the 495 total
HIPAA score, thanks to your provider, you have already achieved a score of 
308. Now if you take the remaining 36 actions, you are going to
get the full score. This score indicates how close or how far you are
from making sure that you are compliant with the particular regulation.

### What discoveries does the assessment prepare?

When you click on, for example, the "Office 365-GDPR" tile, you can
find a lot of valuable materials inside. The first part displays all the
services compliant with GDPR (this list will be different for
various assessments).

![](https://o365hq.com/images/247.png)

It is followed by the provider's part of compliance work, with a very
detailed description of what was implemented and how it was examined by
independent third-party auditors.

![](https://o365hq.com/images/249.png)

### What about your responsibility?

The last section provides not only a description of a rule, but also
actions you can take and Microsoft Cloud features that can be employed
to implement it and become compliant with it. For example, let's take
control of securing application services on public networks. This
control maps to Article (32) (1) (a) and Article (5) (1) (f) of
GDPR requirements, but the actions that you take for this
control also give you the ability to comply with five other certifications
and get a score across all of them. This coordination is possible thanks
to one single control framework and is intended to optimize the amount
of work that you need to do across all the standards.

![](https://o365hq.com/images/248.png)

As you move on and go for more, you will see the above-mentioned
actual detailed customer actions that your organization is recommended
to do to satisfy these control requirements. Customer actions have two
distinct categories:

1.  Procedural actions (explaining what the responsibility is for the
    organization);
2.  Technical configuration involving various Microsoft Cloud features
    (with links to satisfy your curiosity on how to implement certain
    controls, for example, Office 365 message encryption for
    GDPR control, which we discuss here).

![](https://o365hq.com/images/250.png)

### What can you do to become compliant?

After your privacy officer goes through this information, he/she can take
decisive actions and assign this control to your tenant admin or
security operation folks. Priority can be selected,
and that's very useful when you're assigning multiple tasks to the same
people and you want to give them a heads-up as to which ones are more
important. Priority can be chosen either based on a compliance score
that guides you and gives you a baseline to prioritize what control you
need to implement first or based on your company's risk profile.

![](https://o365hq.com/images/253.png)

Once the privacy officer selects the priority, leaves his/her notes, and
hits "Assign," the e-mail is sent to your tenant admin or security
operation person.

![](https://o365hq.com/images/252.png)

the email contains a link to the Compliance Manager and after authentication,
the IT specialist will see the scope of work he/she needs to complete.
Actions of the IT specialist could vary from anything like implementing and
reviewing business policies to implementing and configuring technology
features within the cloud. Once the assignment is done, the status can
be switched from "Planned" to "Implemented" and the current date
entered.

To provide evidence that the work was completed, the IT specialist uploads
the policy document, a screenshot, a group policy export, or some other
configuration setting (under "Manage Documents"). These documents are
restricted to only authorized users of this tool.

Now the task can be reassigned back to the compliance officer to verify
the implementation of that control and mark it as either passed or
failed. When the task is reassigned, it will disappear from the admin's
action items. The compliance officer examines the information and evidence
provided by the IT pro and after a satisfactory review, changes the status to
"passed." On the dashboard, changes will be visible not only for the
GDPR control that was actioned upon, but for NIST and
three ISO controls connected with it as well.

### Reporting

All this valuable information that was discussed above can be exported
to a single report. It will contain implementation details and test
plans for all controls, as well as the evidence that you have uploaded.
This enlightening document can be shown to your external or internal
auditors or regulators to demonstrate end-to-end compliance on top of
Microsoft Cloud.

### How are the permissions managed?

At the outset, any user in a cloud tenant has access to this tool.
There's no tenant data there before organizations add any information or
upload evidence. Neither does it have any connection to the tenant's security
configuration and cannot detect things in the tenant's environment.
Organizations can assign five permission roles by clicking "Settings."
After users are designated with the role, the initial permissions are
removed and they can act only according to the new role.

### Conclusion

It is surely worth it to broaden your staff with one more compliance manager,
but a digital one. This tool is a great assistant and adviser; it won't
do the work for you, but it will make it "weightless" by providing all
the necessary information, instructions, and a place for fruitful
collaboration for employees involved in the compliance process. So, use
it for your own benefit!
