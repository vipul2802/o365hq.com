as usernames, passwords, and credit card details (and money), often for
malicious reasons, by disguising as a trustworthy entity in an

Although there is no silver bullet to prevent malware attempts like
phishing, a combination of email filtering and Web protection solutions
can work together to block malware from gaining access to your network.
Email spam and virus filtering in Windows 10 is an excellent start to
keep malware from being delivered by email; but what about when surfing
the Web? Email filtering and Web protection solutions together can
keep your network safe so you can focus on more important tasks.
