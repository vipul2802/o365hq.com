### What if I stay with Office 2013?

You can keep outdated versions of the software as long as you are
comfortable with the increased security risk you will face. Microsoft
will not take any active measures to block older Office clients from
connecting to Office 365 services though all ongoing investments in the
Office 365 cloud services will proceed based on post -- Office 2013
requirements. Microsoft Help may not be able to resolve issues that
arise due to unsupported service connections and you may eventually find
yourself out of compliance depending on specific regional or industry
requirements.

### Can I upgrade to Office 2019?

Unlike Office 365, which is updated regularly with new features, Office
2019 is not. As soon as the new desktop version is released, you must
purchase it again if you would like to have access to new features. If
you decide to upgrade to Office 2019, you have to remember that support
for Office 2016 and Office 2019 connections to Office 365 cloud services
ends in October 2023. Up to date information on current system
requirements can be found under on the Office system requirements page,
with related timelines available in the Office system requirements
matrix.

### What are my next steps?

We strongly recommend you consider migrating to Office 365 ProPlus (name
has been recently changed to Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise), an
ongoing access to the actual versions of Microsoft\`s best corporate
apps connected to the cloud. Office 365 ProPlus is the best way to work
with services Office 365 with continuously updated and improved apps. To
make the transition process smoother, Microsoft is offering FastTrack
migration, a service providing organizations with the tools to help them
make the move from one Office version to another.

Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise (formerly Office 365 ProPlus) is for
sure the most secure Office, that provides your teams with a great
opportunity to work together seamlessly from anywhere and on the go.
