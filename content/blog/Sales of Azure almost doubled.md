Microsoft Corp. on Thursday topped Wall Street forecasts for quarterly
profit as the technology company signed up more businesses to its Azure
cloud computing services and Microsoft 365.

Azure's growth has propelled Microsoft to the No. 2 position in the
\$15.6 billion cloud computing market, with a 14 percent share, behind

    billion.

    direction increased by 17% and amounted to \$ 7.9 billion. Azure
    cloud platform sales increased by 93%; the company does not give
    absolute figures.
-   Demand for cloud servers is growing, as more and more organizations
    are trying to reduce storage costs and transfer information to
    third-party data centers.

    14% of the cloud computing market, behind only Amazon Web Services

with a Surface that is both a tablet and a PC,"* said Rebecca Wettemann,
an analyst with Nucleas Research. *"Apple is still playing catch up to
that."*
