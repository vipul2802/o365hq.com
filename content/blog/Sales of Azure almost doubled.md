Microsoft Corp. on Thursday topped Wall Street forecasts for quarterly
profit as the technology company signed up more businesses to its Azure
cloud computing services and Office 365.

\$15.6 billion cloud computing market, with a 14 percent share, behind

    billion.

    direction increased by 17% and amounted to \$ 7.9 billion. Azure
    cloud platform sales increased by 93%; the company does not give
    absolute figures.
-   Demand for cloud servers is growing, as more and more organizations
    are trying to reduce storage costs and transfer information to
    third-party data centers.

    14% of the cloud computing market, behind only Amazon Web Services

an analyst with Nucleas Research. *"Apple is still playing catch up to
that."*
