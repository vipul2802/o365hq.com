Your sensitive data is being exploited by some sort of phishing attack
all the time. Microsoft Defender for Office 365 continuously
identifies tons of various malicious URLs and email attachments
and prevents them from reaching your mailboxes. Microsoft Threat
Protection offers high-quality assistance to keep your business and
employees safe. Microsoft reveals some sophisticated techniques
attackers use to abuse different legitimate cloud services.

### Hijacked search results

Phishing attacks have become increasingly clever over recent years. This
new technique implies the use of URLs that point to a
legitimate source but route to compromised websites. This enables 
cybercriminals to send spoofing emails with legitimate URLs and
trusted domains. Your employees can easily fall victim to such attacks
by just clicking the Google link, as this will redirect them to a
hacker-controlled phishing website.

### 404 Not Found pages

Another technological approach phishers use to hide phishing links is to
use multiple URLs and multiple domains for their attacks, such
as Custom 404 pages. It looks like a legitimate Microsoft account
sign-in page and redirects employees to a fake phishing page.

### Man-in-the-Middle phishing attack

Lately, it has become exceedingly difficult to spot and mitigate
phishing attempts. Cybercriminals have improved their skills in
impersonation and become a real threat to all types of organizations.
Hackers use a man-in-the-middle component to collect company data like
logos, content, and images. Attackers spread out emails with
URLs redirecting to an attacker-controlled server that detects
information based on the recipient's email address and then gathers
data specific to that organization.

### Microsoft Defender for Office 365

Spoofing emails are very stealthy, and as long as cybercriminals stay
undetected, they can easily trick employees into revealing confidential
company data. Microsoft Defender for Office 365 is a great way to defend your
users from malicious phishing scams at the early stages of campaigns. It
offers protection solutions and advanced security technologies that
block all the phishing attempts in real time.
