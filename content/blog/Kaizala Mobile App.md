### Familiar chat experience

With Microsoft Kaizala, it is very easy to quickly complete tasks
and communicate with the team when you are not at work and have
limited access to a computer. Kaizala helps you stay connected to your
team members, partners, and customers. With a familiar, intuitive look
and feel, you can have a conversation with your teams in a clutter-free
environment, complete with everything from photos, to surveys and polls,
to creating job cards and custom actions. If you need to connect with
other people through groups, you can start or join a group in three ways:
*Nearby Groups, QR Code, Group Code*. Kaizala is perfect for
working on the go, utilizing 2g+ handsets and networks.

All group members can add announcements, upload quizzes, training,
surveys, and conduct polls. It is possible to broadcast an announcement
to a group or groups within groups and send text messages to the group,
to acknowledge the team's great work so they can feel connected and
acknowledged. In addition to text messages, it is very simple to send
attachments like pictures, audio, video, or files. You can share photos
from the field. Unlike other chat applications, the group of images
shared on Kaizala is shown as a photo story rather than individual
messages, thus reducing clutter. So, the team will find the collections
more useful and less cluttered than individual photos.

With Kaizala, you can design custom polls to gather information in real
time from staff, partners, and customers. It is possible to set a poll
expiration date and time, set the privacy parameters, and track results
as the team takes the poll. A *Quick Poll* shows up as an alert in the
teams' profiles and with one click they can respond quickly and
easily.

You can review everything in your *Profile*, take the poll yourself, and
check the number of responses from the team. Clicking Submit Response
will save the poll replies. Kaizala presents the poll results in a
user-friendly way, and the responses are updated in real time as they're
captured. Kaizala allows users to place a star by important messages. By
clicking on *Starred Messages*, you will see all your messages in one
location. With Kaizala, you can use a *Job* card attachment to assign
work to the team and track progress along the way, add comments to show
progress, or mark the task complete once done.

Kaizala comes with 10 actions out of the box. Kaizala has a selection of
location-aware cards that are very helpful for mobile teams and lets you
know where members are located. This is especially helpful when
assigning tasks, as you can quickly find a team member in the closest
location to complete the work.

With the *Survey* action card, it is simple to take feedback from
employees. With a survey, you can ask multiple styles of questions (like
multiple-choice, free text, numeric, or even an image) and get more
information than the poll. With the multiple-choice question, it is
possible to add additional answers and allow for multiple responses. And
with a numerical question, you can add a scale type of response.

Kaizala supports a unique feature of groups within groups, which maps an
entire organizational hierarchy. It is important to note that
individuals directly added to the group as its members can receive and
send messages, and groups added as members of the group can only receive
messages.

If you need to find the latest news in your area, you can use *Discover*
to connect with different groups. Public Groups help you get news
updates, unite publicly with businesses, and much more. *Public groups*
allow anyone to join common interest groups, get news updates, or for
example, connect with leaders and other citizens in their district.

Kaizala APIs are used to automate workflows and integrate with
existing systems, such as ERP, CRM, etc. You can
easily create everything from health intake forms and work orders to
kudos for the team.

### Management Portal

The Kaizala Management Portal provides advanced IT administration
capabilities to manage organizational groups, bulk-upload users, map
groups to the organization to view reports, view rich reporting and
analytics, create custom action cards, and write connectors to integrate
with existing systems. It is easy to create a Kaizala group quickly by
using CSV files containing information of the users and the
team hierarchy.

You can apply different policies in the group: make Office 365 login
mandatory, allow copy, share, forward, and reduce noise by applying
policies around likes and comments, etc. You can manage and upload new
policies and procedures, and the changes are made in real time. When an
employee leaves, it is possible to retrieve all the groups in which the
user is an active member. Users can be removed from one or more groups
easily in one go. The portal contains out-of-box reports for Jobs,
Surveys sent in the groups, and Polls. In the Jobs report, you can track
status of Jobs sent in a group and see how many are still pending.

Microsoft Kaizala helps you cooperate with your colleagues with the help
of a very convenient chat interface.

coordinate, manage tasks, create polls, surveys and more, inside and
outside of the organization.
