There exist some common techniques cybercriminals use to mislead users.
One of them is to set up a fake website that falsely claims the
legitimacy of the software licenses and subscriptions offered for sale.
Experienced cyber criminals even go to great lengths to make websites
look authentic and to trick consumers into buying fraudulent
subscriptions or counterfeit software.

We have collected some tips to help you acquire a legitimate license. The
following instructions will allow you to stay on the right track and
avoid purchasing fake software.

**1.** Beware of huge discounts. It may seem very attractive, but it may
not be true. Microsoft's discount programs are available for all
partners, but if the low price is found only in one store -- that can be
considered a red flag.

**2.** All Microsoft partners have their own profiles on the MPN
website (you may see ours [on the
link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/solution-providers/partnerdetails/it-partner-%28office-365-azure-and-cloud-solutions%29_18f52792-7cb2-42db-a422-bba05b359540/0bbc85bb-e3bc-4233-af48-94383081bae3)
). If you don't see a company on the catalog, it likely means it is
committing fraud.

**3.** Consultations and additional services. Do not hesitate to call a
seller and ask some simple questions about the difference between
CSP and OLP. Microsoft Certified Partners are always
ready to help you with deployment and implementation services, while
cybercriminals are not able to migrate your mail server or provide any
other complex solution of implementation projects.

**4.** It is crucial to figure out whether Microsoft software installed
on your PC is properly licensed. When implemented correctly, Microsoft's
volume licensing solutions are designed to make it easier and more
affordable to run software on multiple computers within a business or
organization. Sometimes scammers will sell you a wrong license that is
cheaper than the one you require.

Make sure you have the right licensing for your Microsoft products. And
if you have any concerns about it, IT Partner will help you ensure that
the software installed on your PCs is properly licensed.
