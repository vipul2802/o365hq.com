-- Fast Company's material on how Microsoft studied the work of live
assistants in order to work out the principle of creating a good virtual
assistant.

*"To study that dynamic, we started interviewing real assistants, asking
them to reflect on their relationships and how their tasks evolved over
time,"* explains Ronette Lawrence, Microsoft's senior director for
product planning and research.

*"The opposite would be overload, giving people all these amazing
capabilities at once that would still have a 30% probably of being
wrong,"* says Friedman. *"Those models don't have pacing that builds to
high-confidence recommendations, then making a trust leap. We're trying
to pace things and work into a relationship, because you have to mirror
how human relationships are built."*
