Cloud App Security alerts you when suspicious actions are discovered,
such as activity from anonymous IT addresses, suspicious inbox
forwarding configurations, ransomware activity and more. This detection
policy considers past activity locations and triggers an alert when an
activity occurs from a new location by any user in the company.

The Activity Log informs you about the activity that triggered the
alert, including the number of open alerts and admin activities for the
IP address. You can also explore the alert further by looking at the
related activities performed during the user session.

After you have investigated alerts, you are ready to set detection
policies on the Policies Page. Here you can check all the policies for
your company. Cloud App Security offers a variety of policy templates
and populates the different properties of the policy. You can analyze
the properties and customize them if needed.

Microsoft Cloud App Security features app permissions that allow you to
see which user-installed apps have OAuth permissions and access to data
from Office 365, G suite, and Salesforce. OAuth enables a user\`s
account information to be used by third-party services, without exposing
the user\`s password. OAuth app permissions help you decide which apps
to allow and which ones to disallow in your environment.

Integration of Microsoft Cloud App Security with Azure Advanced Threat
Protection and Microsoft Power Automate provides user entity behavior
analytics, custom alert automation and orchestration playbooks. By
creating a playbook, you can use workflows to authorize customized
governance options for your policies.

Microsoft Power Automate also integrates with hundreds of third-party
connectors, including Exchange Online, Slack, ServiceNow, Jira and more.
You can easily configure your workflow to post an alert message to Teams
when triggered. And then navigate to the Policies Page to set a policy
to use Power Automate. Now, when accessing Outlook, you will be
redirected through Cloud App Security and notified that access to
Microsoft Exchange Online is monitored.
