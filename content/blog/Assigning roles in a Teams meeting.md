Scheduling or starting a meeting automatically makes you the *Organizer*
of the event. If you're planning a meeting with multiple attendees, it
is possible to assign roles to each participant to determine who can do
what in the meeting. *The Organizer* can choose from two roles:
*Presenter* and *Attendee*.

*Presenters* take part in a meeting chat, share video and content,
remove and mute other participants, privately view a PowerPoint files
shared by others, admit people from the lobby and manage recording. The
role of an attendee is more controlled. *Attendees* can only speak and
participate in a meeting chat, share a video and privately view a
PowerPoint file shared by someone else.

Once you have sent out the meeting invite you are ready to assign roles.
In Teams basically everyone is a presenter, so it might be a problem if
you are organizing a large event. But now with a new feature with the
help of *Meeting options* you can do some changes while scheduling a
meeting.

This allows you to define who can present a meeting, and there are a few
choices:

1.  *Everyone* -- Anyone who has access to the meeting link.
2.  *People in my organization* -- Only users in your company in the
    same Office 365 tenant.
3.  *Specific people* you select from the list of invites.
4.  *Only me* -- Only the organizer. All others will join as attendees.

There are also a few ways to change someone's role while a meeting is in
progress.

[Choose specific people.]{.mark}

To select specific people, send your invite first, choose the meeting
options, then search for a participant and using the drop down choose as
many presenters as you wish. It is possible to select only internal
attendees.

[Use People pane.]{.mark}

It is easy to reach Meeting Options right from the People pane. You can
just click on the Manage permissions button and a web browser will open
with Meeting Options. This is useful if you start a meeting with "Meet
now".

You can also click *Show Participants* in the meeting controls to see a
list of the people in the meeting. Then select *More options* (...) in
the People pane next to the person you want to make an attendee and use
the drop down to select *Make an attendee.* You will get a warning
first, select *Change* on that to perform the change.
