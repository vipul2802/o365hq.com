### What is Teams Phone with Calling Plan? 

Teams Phone with Calling Plan brings together calling, chat, meetings, and collaboration into a single app, enabling users to make phone calls from anywhere, on any device—including computers, smartphones, desk phones, and meeting rooms. To use the Teams Phone System with Calling Plan bundle, you need a Microsoft 365 account that has Teams Phone with Calling Plan bundle licenses. Once you have an account and licenses, you can start managing your employees' phone numbers.  

Teams Phone with Calling Plan can be added to the following eligible subscriptions: Microsoft Teams Essentials, Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Business Standard, Business Premium, F1, F3, E3, A3, and Office 365 F1, F3, E1, E3, A1, A3. 

To set up Calling Plans, Operator Connect, or Teams Phone Mobile to your users, you need to get numbers for your users and assign phone numbers to them. In Microsoft Teams, the phone number you assign is listed when a user clicks **Calls**.
