Today, Microsoft calls it "the world's productivity cloud" and it
represents a vision for the future of Microsoft productivity tools -- an
integrated set of apps and services that puts artificial intelligence
(AI) and other cutting-edge innovations to work for you. And for small
and medium-sized businesses, this includes new capabilities in Microsoft
Teams to help you host rich meetings and events online, access cloud file
storage and sharing capabilities so you can collaborate from anywhere,
and offers security and identity solutions to safeguard your business.

The new product names go into effect on April 21, 2020. This is a change
to the product name only, and there are no pricing or feature changes at
this time.

1.  Office 365 Business Essentials will become Microsoft 365 Business
    Basic.
2.  Office 365 Business Premium will become Microsoft 365 Business
    Standard.
3.  Microsoft 365 Business will become Microsoft 365 Business Premium.
4.  Office 365 Business and Office 365 ProPlus will both become
    Microsoft 365 Apps. Where necessary, we will use the "for business"
    and "for enterprise" labels to distinguish between the two.

Note that the changes to these products will all happen automatically.
