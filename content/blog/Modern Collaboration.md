Within Teams desktop and Teams mobile there is an option to deliver
your chats in multiple ways, including marking them as *Important* or
*Urgent*. Urgent messaging will notify a person or group repeatedly,
every 2 minutes for 20 minutes, until the message is read. A lot of
communication within a team is ad hoc. Teams makes it easy to see who's
available, chat and meet with them, and share files and information
across devices.

When the time comes for the campaign launch, you and your team can
create a Live Event, broadcasting a video of the launch and meeting
content to larger online audiences. Live events in Teams offers a quick
setup of live events without an external device or app, and includes
moderated Q&A to improve audience participation inside or outside an
organization.

Another way to hold meetings in Teams is with *Meet now*. With Meet now,
meetings are created within a channel of the team, inviting all team
members. *Blur my background* removes any distractions, enabling
attendees to focus on what matters most. During a meeting, participants
can use rich meeting capabilities, such as video, screen sharing, file
sharing, meeting notes, and chat to make the meeting engaging and
productive. You can always record your meeting for future reference. The
recording is saved to *Microsoft Stream*, so employees can share it
securely across an organization.

*Live Captions & subtitles* enhance the accessibility and efficiency of
various live events by allowing attendees to read speaker captions in
real time.

As a communication and collaboration tool, Microsoft Teams has built-in
accessibility features reflecting the diversity of its users and
empowering everyone on the team.

With the default color theme of Microsoft Teams, people with certain
vision disabilities may have difficulty navigating through Teams and
reading content.

Not only does *High Contrast Mode* enable someone with reduced contrast
sensitivity read easily and quickly, it also helps with eye fatigue
by reducing eye strain for any user.

For team members with visual disabilities, or for those that are
emerging readers, *Immersive Reader* boosts readability and
comprehension of channel conversations within Teams. *Text Preferences*
and other features help your team increase focus and understanding.

You can leverage *Microsoft Accessibility* to check your presentation
for accessibility, such as ensuring that each slide contains subtitles
to make the presentation easy to navigate for anyone with disabilities.
It is also possible to use *Live Captions and Subtitles* to add live
subtitles for an audience with disabilities, or an audience that speaks
a different language, to your campaign presentation.

*Safe Attachments* helps to protect against zero-day malware in email
attachments, taking this protection a step further. Suspicious
attachments are opened in a virtual environment and tested against
Windows, Office, and common third-party apps. Attachments are not released
until they're safe. Safe attachments will also protect you in OneDrive,
SharePoint, and Microsoft Teams.

*Announcements* in Teams let you highlight important news in a channel.
Using them in team channels is a great way to kick off a new project,
welcome new team members, or share results from a recent marketing
campaign.

*Praise* in Teams is a simple way to recognize fellow team members right
within the Teams app, where the whole team can see it. Your entire team
can celebrate every success, communicate appreciation, and foster
greater comradery.

Teamwork is made easy with Office 365 apps integration into Microsoft
Teams, enabling you to cooperate with your team members and edit files
-- all from one location. With Office 365 ProPlus, your team can be more
productive and inclusive as they create, communicate, and collaborate on
team projects.
