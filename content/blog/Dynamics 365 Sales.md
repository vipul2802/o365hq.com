### Inside Sales

With Dynamics 365 for Sales, you can easily create new leads and follow
up after sales. Once you've named the lead and gathered the customer's
contact information, it can be qualified. All the activities are
automatically created by a workflow.

Dynamics 365 can also surface suggested products for cross-sell. To
speed up different kinds of requests, it is possible to add a chat bot to
handle special requests. This bot can be created using the Microsoft Bot
Framework, a set of tools and APIs for creating intelligent
chat bots. With some additional coding, you can extend this bot to take
additional actions, such as automatically updating the opportunity, or
dynamically generating a discount for a customer based on their profile
and history with your company.

Dynamics 365 also provides the ability to automatically generate a
document, such as a quote or contract, from a template right within
Dynamics 365. Dynamics 365 includes seamless integration with Adobe
Sign, which enables your company to close deals more quickly online.
Once you click Send Agreement, Dynamics 365 automatically generates an
email to all the signers with a copy of the document attached. Customers
can type, draw, or use a photo of their signature to sign. Finally, the
customer can download a copy of the signed document for their records.

### Sales Representative

The Dynamics 365 add-in for Outlook gives mobile sellers access to sales
data within the context of an email--whether it's on their desktop PC,
a laptop, tablet, or mobile phone.

When you click on the Dynamics 365 icon in the email, you get access to
details that are relevant to this opportunity, including contact
information, account details, and related opportunities. By clicking on
the opportunity, you get more information. This helps the sales rep
arrive prepared for their next meeting with the customer.

Once the sales rep arrives at their meeting, they can continue to access
the information they need using the Dynamics 365 app for tablet and
phone. The Relationship Assistant surfaces recent information that's
useful to the sales rep based on data in Dynamics 365 and Microsoft
Outlook.

The sales representative can also quickly generate a quote document from
a Word template right in the customer meeting. Through integration with
Adobe sign, sales reps can send documents and get electronic signatures
from within Dynamics 365 or the Dynamics 365 app.

### Partner Selling

The partner dashboard displays data and information that's relevant to
the partner relationship. The Distributed Opportunities table shows
opportunities that are available for the partner to work on.

When you click on an opportunity, you can see the full details,
including opportunity size, timing, and so on. Once an opportunity has
been accepted, it moves to the Managed Opportunities table. This table
lists all the opportunities the partner is currently working on.\
Portals in Dynamics 365 include a rich knowledge base, self-service, and
case management capabilities. As soon as an opportunity is accepted, the
partner can edit it and add details.

### Sales Performance

Dynamics 365 integration with Power BI helps companies gain visibility
into sales data from the executive level down to the individual sales
representative. Power BI Dashboards can be embedded in Dynamics 365 to
provide intelligence for specific teams or job roles. Here there are
several data points that are of interest to a sales manager, including
Won Revenue, current Average deal size, and current Lead
Qualification Rate. You can also open this dashboard in Power BI to get
access to more features and analysis. Built-in intelligence in Power BI
lets you ask questions about your data and get answers in real time. The
Sales Performance tab demonstrates metrics associated with your current
sales performance. These visualizations are interactive.

Gamification is a new service that allows users to take part in various
competitions and where you manage your current games. Such games
stimulate them to accomplish certain predefined KPIs by
awarding prizes and benefits.

You can also add spectators. Spectators aren't competing in the game,
but they can view it. For example, we could add members of the
management team to give them visibility into the game. Finally, we can
specify prizes for the game.
