Here are the top benefits of the new Windows Virtual Desktop in Azure:

### Secure and productive remote work.

With WVD you get full Windows 10 and Windows Server desktop on your
device from any location. The integration of WVD with Microsoft 365 Apps
for enterprise and Teams allows your end users to be efficient while
using the desktop experience they are used to.

Windows Virtual Desktop provides flexibility for your employees and
allows them to work anywhere at any time.

### Sustainability and Lower Cost of Infrastructure.

With Windows Virtual Desktop it is possible to have multiple concurrent
users by maximizing use of your virtual machines through the Windows 10
multisession capacity.

With eligible Windows or Microsoft 365 licenses, you pay only for what
you use when accessing Windows Virtual Desktop.

### Simple IT management.

Windows Virtual Desktop runs the virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI)
for you, so you can concentrate on users, apps, and OS images instead of
hardware inventory and maintenance.

With WVD it is easy to get your users up and running with limitless
scale and full automation based on your business needs.

### Security and Protection.

Windows Virtual Desktop provides you and your team with enhanced
security. With built-in Azure Site Recovery and Azure Backup
technologies it is easy to protect against outages and stay productive.

Azure Service Health dashboard helps you with guidance and technical
support when Azure service issues or updates affect your Azure
resources. It allows you to mitigate downtime and prepare for planned
maintenance.

Such security solutions like Azure Firewall, Azure Sentinel, and Azure
Security Center reduce vulnerabilities and keep your virtual desktops
safe.
