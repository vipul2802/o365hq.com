### Why choose Microsoft 365 Education

products are available free or at a
discount](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/buy-license/microsoft365)
to verified educational institutions. Some highlights include:

-   Unlimited Free Office 365 A1 licenses for staff and students

### How to register your EDU authorized tenant

If you don't already have an Office 365 tenant -- an admin center under
which you control every aspect of your account and its users -- check
out the [instructions
here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/education/deploy/create-your-office-365-tenant)
for setting one up.

In this step, you'll enter all the basic information about your
organization and create your Global Admin account. You'll then be in the
Office 365 Admin Center, ready to try Office 365 Education on a trial
basis.

### How to get your EDU eligibility approved by Microsoft

If your top-level domain is ".edu" and you entered it while creating
your tenant, then you're done!

If you don't have ".edu" as your top-level domain, you'll now [open a
support
ticket](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/contact-support-for-business-products?view=o365-worldwide)
with Microsoft.

To speed things, if you're already working with a Microsoft sales
representative, make sure to let them know you're opening the ticket,
and drop the sales rep's name when you interact with support.

When you hear back from the support representative, be ready to provide:

1.  Your organization's name
2.  Segment (K-12 OR Higher Education)
3.  Entity Website URL
4.  Your Contact Email
5.  Your Microsoft tenant ID
6.  Organization Domain
7.  Organization Address
8.  A Certificate from a local government or ministry of education
    stating that this is an accredited educational institution, stating
    the organization name and address, and the segment (K-12 or Higher
    Education)
9.  Local government organization registration certificate that shows
    the organization name and address, and the business segment

### IT Partner will prepare your tenant for license activation

When you are ready to activate the licenses you will use beyond the
trial period, IT Partner will consult you on the purchasing process and
initiate your access.

To connect your tenant to the licenses, it is necessary for IT Partner
to have limited authorization on your tenant.

We take your security and privacy very seriously, and we recognize that
you may be subject to strict regulations around access to your systems.
IT Partner will work closely with you to make the process compliant with
your policies.

A user with global admin permissions will be able to authorize IT
Partner's use of the tenant. The provisioning can be done in seconds,
even as you supervise during a screen sharing session.

Complete the process by filling out our [New Customer
form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=jerWToZvHUG34DdAG9ubaGbNn0XlEsdGmwZuhYBTb1tUQkMwMzdVSDdZOUgzQUgzWTVPQUVMMzFZNi4u). If you need help
