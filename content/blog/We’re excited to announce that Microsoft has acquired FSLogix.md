To help extend virtualization capabilities and provide an even richer
experience for Microsoft 365 customers, Microsoft is excited to
announce the acquisition of FSLogix.

In September 2018, Microsoft announced Windows Virtual Desktop --
a Microsoft 365 service that empowers customers to run a modern desktop 
experience on Azure. Office 365 ProPlus is already the best Office experience. 
With the FSLogix acquisition, customers will benefit from the faster load times for user
profiles in Outlook and OneDrive, enabling Office 365 ProPlus to deliver
even higher performance in multiuser virtual environments (including
Windows Virtual Desktop).
