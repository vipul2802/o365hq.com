description = "Microsoft will not take any active measures to block older Office clients, such as Office 2013 and Office 2010, from connecting to Microsoft 365 services. However, legacy clients attempting to connect to a modern, always up- to- date cloud service may experience performance and reliability issues."

Customers will face an increased security risk, and may find themselves
out of compliance depending on specific regional or industry
requirements. Microsoft Help may not be able to resolve issues that
arise due to unsupported service connections.

As previously announced, Office 2013 clients' connections to commercial
Microsoft 365 services will not be supported after October 13, 2020. After
this date, ongoing investments in the Microsoft 365 cloud services --
including Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and OneDrive for Business
-- will proceed based on post-Office 2013 requirements. We recommend
that organizations with Office 2013 clients consider migrating to Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise.

Support for Office 2016 and Office 2019 connections to Microsoft 365 cloud
services will continue until October 2023. Up to date information on
current system requirements can be found under on the Office system
requirements page, with related timelines available in the Office system
requirements matrix.
