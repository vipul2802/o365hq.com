description = "Every industry and every organization is being reshaped by the digital transformation. During the last few decades, the world became wired together into a giant network. At the center of this change are people. Creating the right culture and upscaling employees is as important for digital transformation as modernizing technology. Advances in cloud computing, mobility, and AI, along with modern workplace technologies like Microsoft 365, help to realize the vision of an intelligent workplace for everyone."

SharePoint underpins the experiences across individuals, teams, and
organizations, powering content management and collaboration across
Microsoft 365. Statistics show 373% more SharePoint framework usage in
the last year.

The SharePoint conference in Las Vegas in 2019 was an exciting event where new
features were announced, allowing the creation of an intelligent workplace for
 employees, embracing three areas:

-   Teamwork and business process
-   Employee engagement and communications
-   Search and content intelligence

During his keynote address, Jeff Teper, Corporate Vice President in
charge of SharePoint, OneDrive, Office, and Office Media Group, informed
attendees that SharePoint is one of the largest cloud services in the world, and
it runs in 29 regions, 54 data centers on 180 000 servers, accessing
a massive amount of Azure storage and computing. Actually, SharePoint is the
biggest customer of Azure storage in the company and in the world.\
There is no simple answer to the question what is SharePoint, as it is both 
an app and a platform. It means you can enjoy existing features of an app or build
on top of it to give customers choice and innovation.

### Teamwork and business processes

Due to customers' need for holistic solutions tying all the Microsoft
products together, SharePoint is now integrated with OneDrive, Teams,
Stream, Yammer, etc. From a user's perspective, it means more convenient
ways of doing everyday tasks, like requesting files from others.
The right-click menu of a OneDrive folder includes the *"Request files"* option.
When you choose it, a link to this folder is generated, which then can be
shared in any preferable form, via e-mail or collaboration tools.

When your colleague follows the link, notification about the file request
appears, along with a button to select files. Requested files are
uploaded directly to the pre-selected folder, with the name of the
person who submitted it appended before the file name. Organizing and
sorting through the uploaded files has never been easier.

While working on a Word document, you may need some help from others.
When you @-mention the person you need assistance from, he/she will get
a notification and a link to the document in question without you ever
needing to attach it manually. You can even create a link for one slide
from the presentation, right-click on it, and send it to point out
only the changes you've made in this particular slide.

Virtual Conference)*

Today, OneDrive and SharePoint support nearly 330 file types for
viewing natively in the service, without the need to download any
additional apps.

Teamwork is impossible without Teams, so SharePoint is embedded there.
For example, under Files there is all the metadata, like in SharePoint,
visually distinguished to easily find, figure out, and understand the
content. The full set of commands will allow syncing files to your
device straight from Teams wherever you go, especially if working
offline.

Among great improvements on the back-end is when you're editing every
other file in OneDrive and SharePoint, only the changes you've made are
automatically synced instead of uploading the whole file. This saves on
performance, network time, and certainly battery life.

Simplifying business processes was another important point during the
conference, and Karuana Gatimu (Principal PM Manager, Customer Advocacy
Group, Microsoft) showed how AI can do  routine work for 
employees so they can focus on the tasks that bring more business
value. Her example was about the Retail group making a seasonal change in
their storefronts.

*A SharePoint list within Teams (Snapshot from the SharePoint Virtual
Conference)*

The full SharePoint list is available inside Teams. Clicking on the
store from the list will bring you to the integrated application,
gathering information from multiple different sources. So, you'll see
elements required for the storefront, a picture of it uploaded by the
employee of that store, annual vendor budget for this store, and a
recent invoice with summarized data.

*Store details in one place (Snapshot from the SharePoint Virtual
Conference)*

Such a beautiful list is created with *Flow*. Now that Power Apps and
Flow are integrated with SharePoint, the horizons of business
optimization are broadening greatly.

Flow gives you connectivity among all the different services in
Microsoft 365. The list above was created with a flow wired to Azure
cognitive services (ACS). When employees are uploading pictures
of storefront displays, ACS is analyzing these pictures against
an earlier created model, describing how they should look. When it
has a certain degree of confidence, it tags a file. The tagging of the
file and altering its properties gives the beautiful icons in the list,
showing which stores are doing displays the way they should.
ACS and Flow are freeing your team, as if the system is doing
this for you, then the people can be doing higher-impact work, like
defining business objectives with more speed or resolving a customer
issue instead of reviewing every image that's coming in from around the
country.

Having this integrated experience in the communication tool where the
team is collaborating is transformative.

*Excel spreadsheet* helps to start modeling data, but you can do more,
and *import it as the SharePoint list*, applying line-item security and
extending a business process even further.

![](https://o365hq.com/images/381.png)

*Import of a list from Excel into SharePoint (Snapshot from the
SharePoint Virtual Conference)*

The tool reads the data inside an Excel file and creates a data model
that can be further refined. Every column can be modified from a *Single
line of text* into a *Choice*, or you can skip it and *Do not import*.
If the column contains *Number*, it can be edited as *Currency* or *Date
and Time*, so it's formatted correctly in the future list.

![](https://o365hq.com/images/385.png)

*Menu to modify the SharePoint list imported from Excel (Snapshot from
the SharePoint Virtual Conference)*

As a result of such refinement, you will get a SharePoint list with
conditional formatting applied to it that visualizes data, giving
insights from it before you even start working. A quick edit button
allows the user to make changes and notify the whole team about them.

, how Marks & Spencer is doing this.

Security and governance of data are also constantly enhanced.
Classification labels are intended to manage data in a consistent way.
*Sensitivity* labels are applied for consistent security, access
policies, and content marking. They control the privacy settings of a group,
and even the level of users' access from an unmanaged device.
*Retention* labels are responsible for retention policies across all
data.

SharePoint now supports full collaboration for protected documents. For
example, you can create a document with access restricted only for the
Executive Team security group. When you enter the SharePoint document
library, the Sensitivity column will be your guide, showing which
documents are available for limited user groups.

The next two new features prevent the overexposure of information. The
first one allows admin to create a DLP (data loss prevention)
policy that blocks anonymous sharing of sensitive files.

With this policy in place, only a limited set of sharing options will be
available for a document containing financial data. It will ensure that
the sensitive data is not overexposed due to anonymous link
sharing.

The second feature allows admin to set a tenant-wide limit for how long
an external user can access shared content in a site. A site owner can
see the list of all external users able to view information on the
site. Without changing the policy, an admin can Extend expiration or
Expire now, without the need to revoke access per site or per user
anymore.

SharePoint Virtual Conference)*

As far as ease of management is concerned, some users were complaining
that the new SharePoint admin experience was missing some classic
features from the previous version. The full feature parity is now
restored, so the admin doesn't have to switch between the two
dashboards.

SharePoint Virtual Conference)*

The top user request was the ability to change sites'
URLs, so this option was also added. When the URL is
changed in the Admin center, the content of the site remains the same,
and admin doesn't have to copy the content from the old site to the new
one. The links pointing to the previous URL will be redirected
to the new site.
