Some enterprises use organizational charts to provide reference points for managerial authority. Such hierarchical diagrams are also called Org Charts or organigrams that display people and positions and include contact information, icons and illustrations. Org charts can help new employees learn more about a company quickly by assisting them in putting names and faces to roles and responsibilities.

With Org charts you can easily:

* Demonstrate the internal structure and hierarchies.
* Define roles and responsibilities.
* Keep user contact info in one single place.
* Learn how to allocate staff and other resources best.

Org charts are a perfect fit for Office 365, a prime source for extracting the data, that goes into org charts. In Office 365, there are several ways for creating an org chart.

### Office 365 Contact Cards

...in Outlook, SharePoint, OneDrive, Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams. The Contact Card includes details about the individual, including contact information, a bio, and email. The “Organization” tab on an employee’s Contact Card shows their place in the company (providing that information has been added to Active Directory).

### Delve

...is an experience within Office 365 that allows you to view relevant content and insights tailored to each person. It has a very simple organizational chart that comes out of the box and shows the org structure when you open a user’s profile page. Delve surfaces content from across Office 365 into a single view, so there is no need for you to move between different apps to find the information that’s important to you. To show the Org chart in Delve, you need to assign the Manager for users in Azure AD or SharePoint online user profiles directly.
