### Hub Sites

SharePoint hub sites combine sites together and create a total and
consistent description of a project, department, or area. All the sites
share common branding, theming, and navigation. You can add numerous
features, such as News, Events, PowerPoint, and third-party
tools. Modular web parts make customizing the hub site easy. Adding web
parts and customizing them allows organizations to plan the site to suit
their needs and set it up as their own.

Employees receive the most recent news right in their SharePoint in
Office 365 or SharePoint mobile app. The news from "organizational news
source" sites will appear right at the top of one's view. The unique
hub provides extra capacities, such as attaching the newest items, an
updated layout, and ongoing support. It is not necessary to create
multiple audience-specific sites for each person in a company if you
configure what can be visible to specific groups.

Audience targeting allows a company to determine those best to reach
with content experiences. It is easy to deliver a more personalized news
experience by setting what is recommended for the current user.

Scoped search allows visitors to focus on finding content most relevant
to their current work. Search results are confined to the hub site,
keeping searches relevant to the content and activities within the hub.

Navigation across the hub site is simple and it enables visitors to
navigate to the related sites, such as Brand, Executive Corner, and
Operations.

### Communication sites

Communication sites are compelling, dynamic sites that communicate
messages to a broad audience. With common navigation and a consistent
look and feel, associated sites provide visitors with an easy-to-learn
experience. For example, they can quickly browse from site to site
without needing to familiarize themselves with different site layouts.

With the Stream site, visitors can experience a complete video viewing
without leaving SharePoint. Microsoft Stream videos are easily embedded
and play right in the web part, which provides a rich playback experience
of a single video or an entire channel, including the capability to
attach closed captions. It is easy to look for a certain keyword in the
transcript and then skip directly to that part of the video.

Yammer allows site visitors to engage, ask questions, get opinions,
and publish links to content. The SharePoint mobile app displays hub
sites, communication sites, their pages, web parts, news, and content
with smooth navigation between associated sites.

### Create organization news

Office 365 allows access to many different sites, Teams, hubs,
communications, and news sources, and enables creating and publishing items
right from a company news site. When building a News article and sending
an email message to the team, you can include images in the banner and
in the body of the article, and even Stream videos. And finally, it is
possible to use Office content, such as a Word document, a PowerPoint
slide deck, or an image like a 3D picture, which renders directly on the
web page.

Once published, organization news articles display with a badge, such as
the SharePoint home page. Companies can have multiple organization news
sites. The SharePoint admin uses PowerShell to set up each site as a
source of authoritative information for the organization, and then
delegates to a site owner who manages the site and its content.

SharePoint communication sites are the ideal solution to broadcast a
message, tell a story, share content for viewing, or highlight
capabilities or people. SharePoint hub sites take the challenge out of
finding just the information visitors need. Hub sites connect
communication sites and modern team sites for consistent navigation and
themes, shared resources, increased team visibility, and scoped search.
