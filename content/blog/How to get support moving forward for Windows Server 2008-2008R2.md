There are only three ways to get support moving forward for Windows
Server 2008/2008 R2 licenses. First, you can purchase extended support
for three years, which is the most expensive route. This can only be
accomplished directly with Microsoft and you would need to be in an Enterprise
Agreement directly with Microsoft.

Second, you can convert your current OS to a newer OS that is supported,
and this can be accomplished through our Volume Licensing Team. The major
issue here is around any applications you have being compatible with a
newer OS.

Finally, you can move that workload to Azure, which will allow you three (3)
years of free support while testing applications on newer operating
systems to beat the 3-year end-of-life deadline.

### Migrate to Azure

You can migrate your on-premises Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server
2008 R2 servers to Azure, where you can continue to run them on virtual
machines. In Azure you'll stay compliant, become more secure, and add
cloud innovation to your work. The benefits of migrating to Azure
include:

1.  Security updates in Azure.
2.  Get three more years of Windows Server 2008 R2 or 2008 critical and
    important security updates, included at no additional charge.
3.  No-charge upgrades in Azure.
4.  Adopt more cloud services as you are ready.
5.  By migrating SQL Server to Azure Managed Instances or VMs,
    you get three more years of Windows Server 2008 R2 or 2008 critical
    security updates, included at no additional charge.
6.  Leverage existing SQL Server and Windows Server licenses
    for cloud savings unique to Azure.

Our Cloud & Automation Team can help with the Migration Services.

We recommend that you migrate to Azure or upgrade to the current product
versions before the support end dates. This lets you take advantage of
the latest product innovations and make sure you have uninterrupted
support from Microsoft.
