With Field Service, everyone and everything can be scheduled, regardless
of type and location of work performed. Dispatchers can automatically
enhance and prioritize a resource's schedule to ensure maximum customer
satisfaction and operational efficiency. Dynamics 365 offers a platform
for servicing customers regardless of appointment type.

The Schedule Board view provides a great tool for you to stay on top of
scheduling and resources. Using the view mode drop-down menu, you can
easily change the time allocation to Hours, Days, Weeks, or Months.

In addition, the Schedule Board provides a map view with resources and
activity.

As you zoom in, details associated with the area are shown in greater
detail. Hovering over pins and other items reveals details about the
location, including work order, customer, and other important information.

setting to initiate specific activities.

Dynamics 365 for Field Service allows a wide variety of options related
to SLAs and delivery windows that can be fully customized. Once
the work order is created, a specific set of steps are prescribed for
the field engineer to follow. When on-site, the field technician will
see this customizable sequence in the mobile app.

Dynamics 365 Field Service provides you with all the relevant
information needed to fulfill your assignments and report on the jobs.
By providing status updates in real time, dispatchers can respond to the
current state of activity of all technicians in the field and make
informed decisions to manage issues as they arise. When a job is
completed, you can easily obtain the customer's digital signature and
close the work order.

The application provides different views to improve planning and
productivity. In the Schedule view, in addition to the Agenda view, you
can see bookings by Day, Week, or Month so you can plan ahead
effectively. The Map View provides a route, distance, and approximate
drive time based on current driving conditions.

The updated status is reported to Dynamics 365, which can be used by
Dispatch to schedule more efficiently. Artificial Learning can be
applied to optimize scheduling based on field-wide, real-time data.

Reports roll up into Dynamics 365 Field Service management and can be
used in Power BI dashboards that evaluate field service actual
performance against metrics. The specific activities are customizable to
vary by item. The technician can take notes on each step, enter the
duration, and add additional steps. On a mobile device, the technician can
take photos using the Camera icon to associate with the work order.

the actual times are recorded. To complete the work order, just
obtain the customer's signature and close the work order. The data is
automatically synced back to Dynamics 365 Field Service.
