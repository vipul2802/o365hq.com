### IT Partner will prepare your tenant for license activation

When you are ready to select the right licenses for your organization,
IT Partner will consult you on the purchasing process and initiate your
access.

To connect your tenant to the licenses, it is necessary for IT Partner
to have limited authorization on your tenant.

We take your security and privacy very seriously, and we recognize that
you may be subject to strict regulations around access to your systems.
IT Partner will work closely with you to make the process compliant with
your policies.

A user with global admin permissions will be able to authorize IT
Partner's use of the tenant. The provisioning can be done in seconds,
even as you supervise during a screen sharing session.

When you're ready, authorization can be granted
[HERE](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?invType=IndirectResellerRelationship&partnerId=4ed6ea8d-6f86-411d-b7e0-37401bdb9b68&msppId=4100178&indirectCSPId=d5c77776-8b4c-4ceb-81da-566aba9c59c5&DAP=true).
