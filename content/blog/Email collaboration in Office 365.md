                                      and share information with other
                                      people in your organization. Public

                                      folder view. A public folder can be
                                      mail-enabled and added as a member
                                      of the distribution group. Email
                                      sent to the distribution group is
                                      automatically added to the public
                                      folder for archiving or later
                                      reference. Public folders also
                                      provide simple document sharing
                                      when you don't have a SharePoint
                                      Online subscription.
