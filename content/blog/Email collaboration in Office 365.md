  Public folder                       Designed for shared access, public
                                      folders provide an easy and
                                      effective way to collect, organize,
                                      and share information with other
                                      people in your organization. Public
                                      folders organize content in a deep
                                      hierarchy that's easy to browse and
                                      always visible in the Outlook
                                      folder view. A public folder can be
                                      mail-enabled and added as a member
                                      of the distribution group. Email
                                      sent to the distribution group is
                                      automatically added to the public
                                      folder for archiving or later
                                      reference. Public folders also
                                      provide simple document sharing
                                      when you don't have a SharePoint
                                      Online subscription.
