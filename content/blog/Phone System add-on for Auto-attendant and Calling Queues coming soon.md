Starting August 1, 2019 Phone System
[Auto-attendant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/what-are-phone-system-auto-attendants)
and [Calling
Queues](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/create-a-phone-system-call-queue)
features will be available as a \$0 add-on for customers who already
have either a stand-alone Phone System subscription and/or an Office 365
suite subscription that includes Phone System. This creates more
flexibility for customers who today are only able to utilize these
features if they have Phone System and a Microsoft Calling Plan.

Customers will be able to acquire 25 0\$ Voice Apps SKUs plus 1
0\$ Voice App SKU for every 10 Phone System licenses they own.
Phone System licenses can be acquired as an add-on or as part of the E5
SKU.
