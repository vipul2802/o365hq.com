title = "Streamline your deployment and migration journey with Microsoft FastTrack"
description = "The key to success for any business is working smarter instead of working harder. The idea of cloud technologies that can make your work a lot easier is very tempting. That sounds great to the business folks -- until the IT guys come along and say there's a whole bunch of work that should be done to get there. Moreover, the cost of transition to the cloud is not limited by the licenses you buy but comprise multiple expenses that arise along the way. At this point, it suddenly seems that it is better to keep to traditional on-premises servers, install them yourself and manage them yourself. But it is a misconception, as investing in aging infrastructure can actually do more harm in the long run. To break this vicious cycle and reduce the cost of cloud transition, FastTrack came to be.

### What is FastTrack?

FastTrack (FT) is a service to accelerate your journey to Microsoft
cloud services, achieve success with these technologies, and drive what
your business is looking to become.

Your engagement with FT is very simple -- as soon as you start thinking
about deployment or migration, you don't even need to buy licenses, you
can create a trial tenant and use your Azure AD global admin credentials
to sign in with FT portal (where you can find resources, trainings, and
workshops).

### How can your organization use FastTrack?

Nearly anyone can leverage standard FastTrack resources. If your
subscription comprises more than 150 seats, you are entitled to ongoing
access to our engineers (mail us) to help guide you from a position of
expertise through your deployment journey with Microsoft 365 (or
separate services it includes, like EMS, Office 365, or Windows
10), Dynamics 365 and Azure Active Directory.

Data migration is a little more reserved service; it requires a 500-seat
minimum in your subscription.

FastTrack is an ongoing process of deploying the technology. For
example, you've taken your data and gotten it up into Exchange and
you're onboarded to mail, but you're interested in getting started with
Teams or employing Intune -- FastTrack can serve you well for the life
of your subscription. You can come back and engage with the team
repeatedly, or even retain the same FastTrack managers over the years
for an ongoing relationship -- of course, if they're still on the job and
you're still doing the same role as well.

The same way that Microsoft updates its products, FastTrack is there to
support you as you evolve in developing the use of technology in your
company.

### Stages of the FastTrack process

The repeatable process FastTrack goes through with tens of thousands of
clients is very simple and comprises three steps -- envision, onboard,
and drive value.

**Step 1 -- Envisioning**

When you think about planning and assessing, FastTrack can assist you in
defining your vision for success and prioritizing your scenarios for the
Success Plan. There are some templates to create the Success Plan of
your particular deployment, specifying your goals, priorities, and
timelines.

**Step 2 -- Onboarding**

In this stage, the engineering team comes into play. There is a lot of
standard technical guidance, but also specialized resources, because
everyone does have a unique scenario, and that's where FT can offer
either best practices or pulling in a subject matter expert to help
remediate and enable a service, really turning it on.

**Step 3 -- Drive value**

Once you've turned on the service, you're just halfway there -- you've
got to deploy it out to your end users and enable them to use it,
employing guides and practices for the rollout of the adoption plan. The
real measure for success is whether or not your employees are utilizing
the product.

### The scope of FastTrack services

You can engage with FT to complete the following tasks:

1.  Onboard to Microsoft 365 services and take your data from wherever
    it exists -- from another service or on-premises servers -- and
    migrate it into Microsoft Cloud.
2.  Deploy chat-based collaboration and productivity apps; in other
    words, Microsoft Teams and Office ProPlus.
3.  Enable identity, device management, and modern security. In terms of
    EMS (Enterprise Mobility and Security suite), you'll be
    helped in deploying Intune, thinking about how to use Outlook mobile
    across your environment to increase productivity in a secure
    fashion, etc.
4.  Offer application compatibility services for the modern desktop. As
    you move to Windows 10 or stay up to date with Office ProPlus,
    FastTrack will have your back to ensure that apps stay compatible as
    you move forward, thanks to Desktop App Assure service.
5.  Gain user adoption and realize business value out of the investment
    that you've made with cloud services.
