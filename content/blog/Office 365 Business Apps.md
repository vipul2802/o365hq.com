### Outlook Customer Manager

*Outlook Customer Manager* enables users to organize client information
next to the inbox, track tasks and projects in progress, and stay on
track with timely reminders. With Customer Manager it is easy to manage
customer relationships more efficiently and generate more repeat
business.

To add a new contact, you can just click on the Customer Manager icon
within Outlook and save the business and contact information. Customer
Manager makes it simple to share contact info with all the staff, so
that everyone is on the same page and customers get a consistent
experience regardless of who calls. If you want to share a new contact
info with your co-workers and staff, just toggle the Boolean from "no" to
"yes."

Once the business contact has been added by clicking Save, you can also
choose to add *notes* and *files* to the contact information for future
reference.

In our example, Megan selects a due date for this task, as well as a reminder date that
will notify Megan when this task is almost due.

Once the contact card and task have been created, you can choose to
create a deal card that provides you with the status of the *deal*, date
of the deal, and deal amount.

To get an all up list of your contacts, companies, deals, and upcoming
tasks, you can click into the Outlook Customer Manager add-in. From the
*Today view*, you can easily prioritize what you work on by looking at
your *Task List*, with corresponding due dates.

the companies you work with and the deals you have made.

### Microsoft Invoicing

With *Microsoft Invoicing* you can easily create professional-looking
estimates and invoices. With Invoicing it is simple to bill your
customers quickly and get paid fast.

Within each invoice, you can view *contact details*, *outstanding
amount* (if any), invoice details, line items, invoice totals, and any
notes for the customer.

It is also possible to send *estimates* to customers. Each estimate
provides you with *details*, including contact information and the
estimate deadline date. It can easily be turned into an invoice once it
is accepted by a customer.

The Invoicing dashboard demonstrates an overview of sent, paid, and
overdue invoices. Within invoice settings, there is an option to change
the email account details, email settings, invoice and estimate numbers,
payment terms, and tax rates.

It is easy to check the status of individual customers via the
*Customers* tab in Microsoft Invoicing. Customers with any overdue
payments are listed in red and easily spotted.

Microsoft Invoicing gives you an opportunity to generate invoices,
easily add services and prices, and convert estimates to invoices in
seconds. Integration with Microsoft Pay allows customers to pay through
a variety of options -- including online payments by credit or debit
card.

### Microsoft Bookings

With *Microsoft Bookings* customers can automatically schedule
appointments for services -- from initial consultation to repeat
maintenance -- anytime, anywhere. With bookings, your team calendar is
automatically updated.

You can easily manage and color coordinate staff appointments and access
the *day view, week view*, and if needed, a *monthly view* of bookings.
Within each booking it is possible to see project information and
appointment times, to help you stay on schedule.

If you publish your Bookings page to your social media accounts,
customers will have a chance to conveniently schedule appointments. It
is very simple to change details of your Bookings pages, such as the
color scheme, and these changes will automatically be updated to your
linked social media accounts.

Additionally, there is an opportunity to create and review a *scheduling
policy* for the Bookings page, designating project time increments,
minimum lead time, and maximum lead time.

You can also choose *email notifications* when an appointment is
scheduled, as well as give customers the option to decide on the staff
members that work on their project.

Bookings is a fast and great way to schedule a meeting. Customers can
easily find available time slots and book appointments 24/7 with the
help of the easy-to-use, customizable webpage. It is very simple for
customers to check your Bookings, set up a meeting, and receive a
calendar invitation. They also have an option to reschedule the meeting.
In the future, customers will have the ability to pre-pay for their
appointments during the Bookings scheduling process.
