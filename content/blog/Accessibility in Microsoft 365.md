People with dyslexia or low vision may prefer hearing, rather than
reading, content. *Read Aloud* reads text out loud while simultaneously
highlighting the related text, improving word recognition and decoding,
and aiding with comprehension and focus.

Read Aloud supports multiple languages and can automatically detect
languages in a multilingual document. You can also choose the voice and
speed you prefer. With Read Aloud, you and your team can stay productive
and listen to the documents while on the go. You can also use Read Aloud
across Microsoft 365, including having web pages read aloud within the
Edge browser.

Once you review your team activities and answer relevant questions, you
can immediately jump into your projects as soon as you arrive at the
office. Microsoft 365 makes it easy to collaborate on your shared
projects throughout the day.

For your team members who are blind or have low vision, have learning
disabilities, are emerging readers, or learning a new language,
*Immersive Reader* increases readability and comprehension of chats,
channel conversations, and documents within Teams.

Your team can consume content in a way that suits their individual needs
and preferences, increasing focus, word recognition, and comprehension
with *Text and Reading Preferences*, and pronunciation with *Grammar
options*. Team members can leverage Immersive Reader across apps within
Microsoft 365.

For team members that are learning a new language or prefer to
communicate in a different language, *Translate* can increase
cross-language understanding and break language barriers. For diverse
teams to collaborate inclusively, it's important that videos are just as
accessible. You and your team can extend and customize your experience
in Teams with *Stream* app integration. *Closed Captions* is used to
focus on what is being said, so you can retain more information.

With AI-generated transcription of recorded meetings, all words spoken
within videos are searchable metadata, making it easier to find
important content across your company.

For someone who is deaf or hard of hearing, this empowers them to
contribute to meetings and follow up with a speaker if they miss
something.\
*Microsoft Whiteboard* is a freeform, intelligent canvas within Microsoft
Teams meetings that brings your team together within the same virtual canvas
for real-time ideation, creating, and collaboration. For those who work
remotely to accommodate their disability, collaborating from anywhere is
critical!

Whiteboard supports automatic *Alt text*, leveraging Microsoft's
Cognitive Vision Service to analyze the content of the image and
automatically suggest a text description.

Soon, Teams meetings and live events will support *Live Captions &
subtitles*, enabling attendees to read speaker captions in real time.

![](https://o365hq.com/images/644.png)

You can use *Live Captions and subtitles* to add live subtitles during
your presentation, leveraging the same AI transcription technology seen
earlier in the Stream video. Live Captions & subtitles supports 12
spoken languages and displays on-screen captions in one of 60+
languages, giving your team access to content, no matter the disability
or environment where the content is consumed.

*Design Ideas* leverages the power of the cloud to design high-quality,
inclusive slides. Designer automatically identifies the text not only as
a list but as a set of dates, turning it into an easily readable
graphic. This is a great tool that enables team members with cognitive
disabilities to focus less on layout and more on content.

Anytime your team members send an email to you, a *Mail Tip* is triggered
reminding senders to run the Accessibility checker before sending the
message. The *Accessibility checker* will ensure that each image has
text and appropriate reading order, making the presentation easy to
navigate for everyone.

At the top of your Microsoft Office apps, you can use *Microsoft Search*
to quickly find what you need. People who are blind and navigate the
ribbon with a screen reader can "see" steps, and people with dyslexia can
describe the feature they're looking for, even if they can't remember the
word!

*Ink Editor* makes editing Word documents better than ever. If you
prefer, you can simply add text and strike through sentences to make
them disappear, revolutionizing the way you work.

Windows Ink is a set of pen-driven experiences that allows you to set
your ideas in motion with your pen. With a touch-enabled device, you can
draw with a mouse, a finger, or a digital pen.

Team members with a cognitive disability or dyslexia can record more
information using the surface pen rather than a keyboard, allowing
inking and erasing in an intuitive and simple way.

For team members with dysgraphia or dyslexia, creating content without
spelling errors can be a challenge. *Dictate* helps team members save
time and produce better results through the power of voice typing. When
you've finished editing your document, you can check for accessibility
before sharing it with your team members.

Windows 10's *Ease of Access* settings let you personalize your computer
to meet your unique needs. The settings are organized by needs --
*Vision, Hearing, and Interaction*. Narrator, a built-in screen reader
for the 36 million people in the world who are blind, is available,
along with text sizing options for the 216 million people who have low
vision.

As many as 1 in 12 men with Northern European ancestry have the common
form of red-color blindness, so *Color filters* are available to get
meaning from color -- like in statements that display profit in green and
loss in red.

Built-in accessibility and inclusivity tools within Microsoft 365
empower everyone on your team through experiences connected across
devices and applications to flexibly work and collaborate in their own
way.

Even on your way to your next meeting, you can easily stay productive on
your mobile phone using Microsoft Teams. Teams has vast integration
capabilities with line of business apps, solving the disjointed workflow
that often occurs in today's organizations.

It is possible to integrate *Planner* into your team's tabs for everyday
task management for the upcoming campaign, which includes a drone
product launch. With *Insert data from picture* in Excel mobile, you can
take a picture of a printed data table with your mobile device and
convert the information into an Excel spreadsheet with a single click,
reducing manual data entry for people with low mobility and dyslexia.

The ability to flexibly work and collaborate with colleagues makes you
and your team more effective and organized with intelligence -- they are
accomplishing more without doing more.

Designing for accessibility and inclusiveness when creating an app is as
simple as adjusting layouts and color themes for easy readability. The
App checker ensures your app is accessible by automatically identifying
issues that make the app difficult or impossible to use and understand
for team members that use a keyboard or a screen reader to navigate
through the app.

The accessible label reflects what most users expect visually within
apps and works well with the screen readers, reducing the barriers of
effective collaboration and enabling the millions of people who are
blind or have low vision around the world to successfully collaborate with
their team.

Integrating line of business systems together into a central location,
like Microsoft Teams, enables you and your team to transform business
processes and accelerate the flow of information across your company,
teams, and systems, from any location.

With free, built-in accessibility and inclusivity tools, not only is the
need for and cost of additional assistive technology reduced, assistive
technology is available to every employee, regardless of whether they
feel comfortable disclosing their disability.

Microsoft 365 is designed with accessibility in mind from the beginning
and complies with international accessibility standards. Microsoft 365
is designed to empower everyone, anywhere, through connected experiences
and integrated workflows, while also enabling organizations to achieve
compliance.
