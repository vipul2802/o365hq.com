The single Office Volume License permits you to install/access Office in
3 ways.

1.  Install on a licensed device
2.  Install on a portable device
3.  Install on a network device

So if you have a device that is already licensed with Office, the
primary user of that device can install Office on their iPad without
needing an additional Office license. But if you don't already own the
license, purchase a single Office VL for that iPad.
