realize the return on your investment by providing the targeted
information you need for effective and efficient deployment, management,
and support of new Microsoft technologies.

classroom training taught by Microsoft Learning Partners. Developed by

helping technical staff get the job done today, as well as make key
contributions in the future.

### Home Use Program

Your employees will welcome the opportunity to get a copy of Microsoft
Office software for use at home. The Microsoft Office Home Use Program
(HUP) provides your employees with a way to buy low-cost downloads
of the Microsoft Office applications they use at work, including the
latest versions of Office, Visio, Project, and Skype for Business. And
it's a truly global benefit, available in 42 languages to employees
around the world.

The Home Use Program provides both employees and organizations with
exceptional value; when employees use the same software at home that
they use at work, they can gain skills and boost productivity with
powerful and familiar applications. Your unique HUP company
code and their work email address is all they need to get started---and
after employees have downloaded their software, they get similarly
discounted upgrades through the length of your organization's active
Software Assurance agreement.

With HUP, you get both the software your employees want and
additional materials to help you get the word out to your organization.

Let your employees join the more than 15 million others to date who have
taken advantage of the Home Use Program!
