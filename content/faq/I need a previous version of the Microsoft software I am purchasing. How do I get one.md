Microsoft always sells the current versions of their products and
services. However, you can get a Product Key and Installation Files for
the previous versions using the Downgrade rights. Downgrade rights is a
benefit available in Volume Licensing channel. Downgrade rights allow
you to obtain a License in any version that Microsoft continues to make
available for download through the Volume Licensing Service Center. For
example, with Windows Server, you can choose to download the 2016, 2012
R2, or 2012 versions of the edition you've licensed. Downgrading does
not depend on Software Assurance; it is a benefit of Volume Licensing.
