You can purchase your Office 365 subscription in a few different ways
(or channels):\

1.  Through the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program. Best for
    any number of users.
2.  Directly from Microsoft through their website. Best for 1-10 users.
3.  In a Microsoft Volume Licensing channel (cheapest option, annual
    commitment). Not recommended.
4.  Via your EA agreement, from your Microsoft Large Account Reseller
    (custom terms).

Please call or email us if you want to
discuss the Volume Licensing option. Otherwise, we recommend you go with
the best overall option, which is the CSP.

[So, why purchase your subscriptions in CSP, or why switch to
CSP from Direct or any other licensing channel?]{.underline}

-   **Access to new plans** -- All new Office 365, Microsoft 365, and
    Dynamics 365 plans appear ONLY in the CSP channel.
    Microsoft's goal is to slowly decommission the Advisor (direct)
    model you are using right now. So, it's better to switch
    sooner rather than later.
-   **Free consulting support** Depending on how much you spend each
    month, you may get a certain number of free consulting hours from us,
    which you can spend on anything IT-related.
-   **Better terms and no cancellation fees** There's no commitment if
    you purchase in the CSP (compare with annual commitment for all
    enterprise (E1-E5) and standalone plans and 25% cancellation fee).
-   **Free break-fix support** -- You get support from us AND
    from Microsoft. Both. It makes sense to have an MS
    Gold Partner on your side in case something happens -- it's easier
    to reach us than Microsoft. We have years of experience working with
    Microsoft and we can escalate complex issues faster and better...
-   *It's not a benefit but worth mentioning.* In the CSP channel,
    **the price is the same** as when you purchase directly from Microsoft.

To move forward with CSP, **you need to do the following**:

1.  Complete our short [New Customer Application
    form](https://office365.typeform.com/to/x5pDX2)
2.  Authorize Tech Data (an official Microsoft distributor) to provision
    licenses to your tenant by clicking [this
    URL](https://portal.office.com/partner/partnersignup.aspx?type=ResellerRelationship&id=d5c77776-8b4c-4ceb-81da-566aba9c59c5&msppid=676268&csp=1)
3.  Optional: Authorize IT Partner if you want to get consulting and IT
    support from us by clicking [this
    URL](https://portal.office.com/partner/partnersignup.aspx?type=Administration&id=18f52792-7cb2-42db-a422-bba05b359540&msppid=4100178)

After that, we will do everything else:

1.  Provision CSP licenses to your tenant.
2.  Work with Microsoft to cancel Advisor (direct) licenses and get a
    refund for the unused portion of your direct subscription, if any.
3.  Send you an invoice for licenses purchased in the CSP channel.
