In Microsoft 365 or Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), a tenant is
representative of an organization. It is a dedicated instance of the
Azure AD service that an organization receives and owns when it creates
a relationship with Microsoft, such as by signing up for a Microsoft
cloud service like Azure, Microsoft Intune, or Microsoft 365. Each Azure AD
tenant is distinct, unique, and separate from other Azure AD tenants.

A tenant name cannot be changed, so choose your name wisely.

A tenant houses the users in a company and the information about
them---their passwords, user profile data, permissions, and so on. It
also contains groups, applications, and other information pertaining to
an organization and its security.
