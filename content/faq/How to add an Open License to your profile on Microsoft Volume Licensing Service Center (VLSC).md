Here are the step-by-step instructions to add a license agreement with
corresponding keys and downloads to your profile in Microsoft Volume
Licensing Service Center (VLSC).

1.  Log onto [Microsoft Volume Licensing Service
    Center](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter)
2.  Click on **Add an Open License to your profile** (see screenshot \#1

    Number** and click **Submit** (see screenshot \#2 below)\

4.  A request will be sent to the administrator of the Agreement (i.e.,
    Licensing ID) who should approve/reject as appropriate.

If you see a warning saying **"Authorization / License combination
number is not valid"** -- it means that you need to verify if your
information is correct.
