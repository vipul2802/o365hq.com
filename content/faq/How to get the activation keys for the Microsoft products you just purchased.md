Usually, the activation process works just fine and there are no
problems at all. However, sometimes issues happen and we have this
article ready for just such situations.

#### So, you received an email from Microsoft with the instructions, but something is not working. For example -- you have an Internet connection, but Microsoft Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC) is not working in your browser.

1.  Please try accessing the [VLSC
    website](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx)
    using either a different browser, different computer, or using an
    InPrivate / Incognito session of your current browser. It may help.
    We can even set up a screen sharing session and go through this
    together -- feel free to contact your account manager at IT Partners
    and schedule a support call or email us at <sales@itpartner365.com>.
2.  You can call MS VLSC support line and ask for help. Live
    agents will be available Monday -- Friday, 5:00 a.m. -- 5:00 p.m.
    (PST). Call the VLSC Contact Center toll-free 
    at (866) 230-0560.
3.  You can submit a written support request using this [Support Web
    Form](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/supportrequestform/2afa6f15-b710-db46-909a-8346017c802f?sl=en&sc=US).

#### If you don't have an Internet connection, but you have a phone.

Call the Microsoft Licensing Activation Centers worldwide telephone
numbers to activate your software over the phone. In the US, the toll number
is (716) 871-2781, and toll-free number is (888) 352-7140. Please check
the [Microsoft Licensing Activation
Centers](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/existing-customer/activation-centers)
website for worldwide telephone numbers.

#### Contact your Microsoft reseller who sold you the licenses.

By default, the reseller gets added to the list of Contacts on the
licensing agreement and can access all the important stuff, including
**License Details**, **List of Products**, **Product Keys**, and **Order
Confirmations**.
