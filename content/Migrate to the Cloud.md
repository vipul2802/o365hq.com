### Why cloud?

To be honest, this is not a question in 2021 COVID19-world, but: 

Before cloud computing, companies had to store all their data and host their IT-services (like email-server) on their own hard drives and servers. This way of treating data is not scalable at speed fast and lack sustainability. Business could lose all the data in a moment. Today, cloud technology means that companies scale and adapt at speed and scale, drive business agility, and reduce costs.

The cloud has transformed our lives as individuals as well. Many of us use cloud services every day. When we update our status on social media, binge a new streaming series, or check our bank accounts we're most likely using applications that are hosted by cloud services. 

### Why Microsoft?

AWS is five times more expensive than Azure for Windows Server and SQL Server ([proof](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/azure-vs-aws/cost-savings/)).
